 ## Root Cause Analysis: Why Protocol Was Violated
 
 ### Primary Issue: **Agent Decision-Making Failure**

+-   Agent got confused about which operations happen where.
+
+### 5. **Agent Operating Outside Session Branch (New Guardrail Issue)**
+-   During testing, the agent inadvertently made changes to the `main` branch, violating the "ONLY WORK IN THE SESSION BRANCH" constraint. This indicates a critical need for a mechanism to ensure the agent is always operating within the correct session branch while an active session is in progress.
+
+### 6. **Missing Passive Restraint Mechanisms (Critical Discovery)**
+-   The repository lacks passive constraint files (e.g., `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`) that would provide continuous guidance to AI agents.
+-   **Passive restraints** are rule files that agents automatically consult before taking actions, similar to how `.editorconfig` enforces coding standards passively.
+-   Without these passive restraints, agents rely solely on:
+    -   System prompts (which can be forgotten or overridden)
+    -   Active validation (which must be explicitly invoked)
+    -   User intervention (reactive rather than preventive)
+-   This absence likely contributed to protocol violations, as there was no persistent, always-available reference for correct behavior.
+-   Passive restraints align with **poka-yoke principles**: they make correct behavior easier and incorrect behavior harder by providing constant guidance.

+2.  **Environment Variable Enforcement**: Leverage session-specific environment variables (e.g., `SESSION_BRANCH`) to dynamically configure git to only operate on the designated branch, or to warn/error if an attempt is made to switch branches.
+3.  **Enhanced Shell Prompt**: Modify the shell prompt (`PS1`) to prominently display the current branch and a clear indicator if it does not match the active session branch.
+4.  **Automated Context Switching**: Explore mechanisms that automatically switch the agent's working directory and git context to the correct worktree/branch upon session activation, and revert upon deactivation.
+5.  **Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks**: Implement client-side git hooks that prevent commits or pushes from occurring if the agent is not on the correct session branch.

+# SOP Research Findings: Best Practices for Procedural Compliance and Error Prevention
+
+## Executive Summary
+
+Based on comprehensive research into Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), error-proofing mechanisms (poka-yoke), and workflow state machines, this document presents findings and recommendations for creating targeted procedural SOPs for the Agent Sessions Protocol. The research reveals that effective procedural compliance requires a combination of:
+
+1. **Clear, action-oriented SOPs** with checklists and visual aids
+2. **Error-proofing mechanisms** (poka-yoke) that prevent or detect violations before they occur
+3. **State machine patterns** that enforce valid workflow transitions
+4. **Automated validation checkpoints** throughout the process
+5. **Enforcement mechanisms** including pre-commit hooks, environment constraints, and automated alerts

+
+### 2. Poka-Yoke (Error-Proofing) Mechanisms
+
+#### Core Principles (Source: ASQ, Kaizen, Six Sigma Daily)
+
+**Poka-yoke** (Japanese: ポカヨケ, "mistake-proofing") is any mechanism that helps prevent errors or makes them immediately obvious when they occur.
+
+**Two Main Categories**:
+
+1. **Prevention (Control) Type**: Makes errors impossible
+   - Physical constraints that prevent incorrect assembly
+   - System locks that block invalid operations
+   - Interlocks that require prerequisite conditions
+   - Example: Car manual transmission requiring clutch press to start
+   - Example: Automatic transmission requiring "Park" or "Neutral" to start
+
+2. **Detection (Warning) Type**: Makes errors immediately visible
+   - Visual indicators (lights, colors, displays)
+   - Audible alarms and alerts
+   - System warnings and error messages
+   - Example: Form validation preventing submission until all fields complete
+   - Example: Password confirmation requiring matching entries
+
+**Six Essential Principles** (Source: Creately, Cleverence)
+
+1. **Elimination**: Design processes to eliminate error opportunities
+2. **Replacement**: Replace error-prone steps with more reliable methods
+3. **Facilitation**: Make correct execution easier than incorrect execution
+4. **Detection**: Identify errors immediately when they occur
+5. **Mitigation**: Reduce the impact of errors that do occur
+6. **Recovery**: Provide clear paths to correct errors when detected
+
+**Implementation Methods** (Source: Cleverence, Fabriq Tech)
+
+- **Contact Method**: Physical sensors detect presence/absence of components
+- **Fixed-Value Method**: Count or measure to verify correct quantity
+- **Motion-Step Method**: Enforce specific sequence of operations
+- **Information Enhancement**: Visual/audible cues guide correct actions
+
+**Benefits** (Source: Kaizen, L2L Manufacturing)
+- Reduces defects and errors at the source
+- Improves quality and consistency
+- Enhances safety by preventing dangerous errors
+- Promotes continuous improvement culture
+- Reduces costs from rework and waste
+
+### 3. Workflow State Machines and Validation
+
+#### State Machine Patterns (Source: Symfony, Microsoft, ManageIQ)
+
+**Core Concepts**:
+- **States**: Discrete stages in a workflow (e.g., "draft," "review," "approved")
+- **Transitions**: Valid movements between states
+- **Guards**: Conditions that must be met for transitions
+- **Actions**: Operations performed during transitions
+- **Validation**: Checks ensuring state/transition validity
+
+**State Machine Workflow Characteristics**:
+- Finite number of well-defined states
+- Explicit transitions between states
+- Entry/exit actions for each state
+- Pre/post-processing around state changes
+- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
+- Checkpoint persistence (saves state after each transition)
+
+**Validation Checkpoints** (Source: Google Cloud Workflows, AWS Step Functions)
+- **Pre-transition validation**: Verify current state before allowing transition
+- **Guard conditions**: Check prerequisites are met
+- **Post-transition validation**: Confirm new state is valid
+- **Checkpoint persistence**: Save state after successful transitions
+- **Rollback capability**: Revert to previous state on error
+
+### 4. Automated Guardrails and Enforcement
+
+#### Guardrail Patterns (Source: AWS Bedrock, GitGuardian, Jira/Restack)
+
+**Pre-execution Validation**:
+- **Pre-commit hooks**: Run checks before code enters repository
+- **Pre-flight checks**: Validate environment before workflow starts
+- **Prerequisite verification**: Confirm required resources exist
+
+**In-process Monitoring**:
+- **Checkpoint validation**: Verify state at critical workflow points
+- **Real-time monitoring**: Track workflow execution metrics
+- **Anomaly detection**: Flag deviations from expected behavior
+
+**Post-execution Verification**:
+- **Output validation**: Verify workflow results meet criteria
+- **Compliance reporting**: Document adherence to procedures
+- **Audit trails**: Maintain complete workflow history
+
+**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
+- **Blocking operations**: Prevent invalid actions from occurring
+- **Warning systems**: Alert operators to potential issues
+- **Automated correction**: Fix common errors automatically
+- **Circuit breakers**: Stop workflows when critical errors detected
+
+## Critical Discovery: Missing Passive Restraints
+
+During the investigation, a critical gap was identified: **the repository lacks passive restraint mechanisms** such as `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`, or similar AI agent guidance files.
+
+### What Are Passive Restraints?
+
+Passive restraints are configuration files that AI coding agents automatically consult before taking actions. They serve as:
+
+- **Persistent rule repositories**: Always available, not dependent on system prompts
+- **Project-specific guidance**: Tailored to the specific workflow and constraints
+- **Automatic enforcement**: Agents check these before operations
+- **Documentation**: Human-readable reference for correct behavior
+
+### Examples of Passive Restraint Systems
+
+**Roo/Cline** (`.roo/rules`):
+- Project-specific rules and constraints
+- File editing policies
+- Branch protection rules
+- Workflow requirements
+
+**Cursor** (`.cursorrules`):
+- Coding standards and practices
+- Prohibited operations
+- Required validations
+- Project structure rules
+
+**EditorConfig** (`.editorconfig`):
+- Formatting standards
+- File encoding rules
+- Line ending conventions
+
+### How Passive Restraints Prevent Protocol Violations
+
+Passive restraints embody **poka-yoke principles**:
+
+1. **Prevention**: Rules prevent incorrect actions before they occur
+2. **Detection**: Violations are flagged immediately
+3. **Guidance**: Clear instructions for correct behavior
+4. **Consistency**: Same rules apply regardless of agent instance
+5. **Persistence**: Rules survive across sessions and conversations
+
+### Missing Restraints as Root Cause
+
+The absence of passive restraints likely contributed to protocol violations because:
+
+- Agents relied solely on system prompts (can be forgotten/overridden)
+- No automatic validation of branch/directory operations
+- No persistent reference for session workflow requirements
+- Lack of preventive mechanisms for common mistakes
+
+### Recommendation: Implement Passive Restraints
+
+Create `.roo/rules` (or equivalent) with session protocol requirements:
+
+```markdown
+# Agent Sessions Protocol Rules
+
+## CRITICAL: Session Branch Adherence
+
+When an active session exists in `_AGENTS/sessions/active/`:
+- MUST work exclusively in session branch `session/{session-slug}`
+- MUST work in worktree directory `.worktrees/{session-slug}`
+- MUST NOT commit to main, dev, or any non-session branch
+- MUST NOT create files outside worktree when session active
+
+## Session Workflow Requirements
+
+### Before Starting Work:
+1. Verify session claimed (exists in `_AGENTS/sessions/active/`)
+2. Verify on correct session branch: `git branch --show-current`
+3. Verify in worktree directory: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/'`
+4. Verify session environment sourced: `echo $SESSION_SLUG`
+
+### During Active Session:
+- All file operations within `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`
+- All git operations on `session/{session-slug}` branch
+- Regular validation of PWD and branch
+- Update worklog.md with progress
+
+### Before Completing Session:
+- All work committed to session branch
+- Session branch pushed to remote
+- Worktree cleaned up
+- Session moved to completed/
+
+## Prohibited Operations During Active Session
+
+- ❌ Switching to main/dev branches
+- ❌ Creating files in repository root
+- ❌ Committing to non-session branches
+- ❌ Working outside worktree directory
+- ❌ Modifying files on main branch
+
+## Required Validations
+
+Before any git commit:
+- Verify on session branch
+- Verify in worktree directory
+- Verify git identity set correctly
+
+Before any file creation:
+- Verify PWD is in worktree
+- Verify file path is within worktree
+
+Before session completion:
+- Verify all changes committed
+- Verify session branch pushed
+- Verify worklog.md updated
+```
+
+## Recommendations for Agent Sessions Protocol
+
+### 1. Create Passive Restraint Files (CRITICAL - NEW)
+
+**Priority: Immediate**
+
+Create `.roo/rules` or equivalent passive restraint file that:
+- Defines session workflow requirements clearly
+- Lists prohibited operations during active sessions
+- Specifies required validations before actions
+- Provides error recovery procedures
+- Includes examples of correct vs incorrect behavior
+
+This file should be:
+- Checked into version control (main branch)
+- Automatically copied to worktrees
+- Updated as protocol evolves
+- Referenced in all session documentation
+
+### 2. Create Targeted Procedural SOPs
+
+Based on the research, we should create four distinct SOPs for the Agent Sessions Protocol workflow:
+
+#### **SOP-001: Session Creation and Initialization**
+- **Format**: Step-by-step checklist with validation checkpoints
+- **Scope**: From session planning to session activation
+- **Key Steps**:
+  1. Create session metadata in drafting folder
+  2. **VALIDATION**: Verify session directory structure created
+  3. Claim session (move to planned/active)
+  4. Create session branch from appropriate base
+  5. **VALIDATION**: Verify on correct branch
+  6. Create worktree for session
+  7. **VALIDATION**: Verify worktree directory exists
+  8. Switch to worktree directory
+  9. **VALIDATION**: Verify PWD is in worktree
+  10. Source session environment
+  11. **VALIDATION**: Verify environment variables set
+  12. Begin work
+
+#### **SOP-002: Active Session Operations**
+- **Format**: Reference guide with poka-yoke mechanisms
+- **Scope**: All operations during active session work
+- **Key Rules**:
+  - ALWAYS work in worktree directory
+  - NEVER switch to main/dev branches during session
+  - ONLY commit to session branch
+  - Validate PWD before file operations
+  - Validate branch before git operations
+  - Use session-specific git identity
+
+#### **SOP-003: Session Completion and Integration**
+- **Format**: Step-by-step checklist with state transitions
+- **Scope**: From work completion to session archival
+- **Key Steps**:
+  1. Finalize all session work
+  2. **VALIDATION**: Verify all changes committed
+  3. Push session branch to remote
+  4. **VALIDATION**: Verify push succeeded
+  5. Create merge/pull request if needed
+  6. Complete session (move to completed folder)
+  7. **VALIDATION**: Verify session metadata updated
+  8. Clean up worktree
+  9. **VALIDATION**: Verify worktree removed
+  10. Archive session documentation
+
+#### **SOP-004: Error Recovery and Protocol Violations**
+- **Format**: Decision tree with recovery procedures
+- **Scope**: Handling protocol violations and errors
+- **Scenarios**:
+  - Working in wrong directory → Recovery steps
+  - On wrong branch → Recovery steps
+  - Files in wrong location → Recovery steps
+  - Worktree not created → Recovery steps
+  - Session environment not sourced → Recovery steps
+
+### 2. Implement Poka-Yoke Error-Proofing
+
+#### **Prevention Mechanisms** (Block errors before they occur)
+
+**Branch Protection**:
+```bash
+# Add to .session-env
+# Lock current branch for session duration
+export SESSION_BRANCH="session/$(basename $SESSION_DIR)"
+export GIT_BRANCH_CHECK="always"
+
+# Pre-command validation function
+validate_session_branch() {
+    local current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
+    if [[ "$current_branch" != "$SESSION_BRANCH" ]]; then
+        echo "ERROR: Not on session branch!"
+        echo "  Current: $current_branch"
+        echo "  Expected: $SESSION_BRANCH"
+        echo "  Run: git checkout $SESSION_BRANCH"
+        return 1
+    fi
+}
+```
+
+**Working Directory Protection**:
+```bash
+# Verify in worktree before file operations
+validate_in_worktree() {
+    if [[ ! "$PWD" =~ \.worktrees/ ]]; then
+        echo "ERROR: Not in worktree directory!"
+        echo "  Current: $PWD"
+        echo "  Expected: .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG/"
+        echo "  Run: cd .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
+        return 1
+    fi
+}
+```
+
+**Git Operation Wrapping**:
+```bash
+# Wrap git commands with validation
+git() {
+    # Validate branch before commits/pushes
+    if [[ "$1" == "commit" ]] || [[ "$1" == "push" ]]; then
+        validate_session_branch || return 1
+    fi
+    
+    # Call actual git
+    command git "$@"
+}
+```
+
+#### **Detection Mechanisms** (Make errors immediately visible)
+
+**Enhanced Shell Prompt**:
+```bash
+# Show branch and worktree status in prompt
+export PS1='[\u@\h \W $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)]$(pwd | grep -q ".worktrees" && echo " [WORKTREE]" || echo " [MAIN]")\$ '
+```
+
+**Periodic Validation**:
+```bash
+# Add to .session-env
+# Run validation every few commands
+export PROMPT_COMMAND="validate_session_state"
+
+validate_session_state() {
+    # Silent validation, just update prompt color
+    if ! pwd | grep -q ".worktrees"; then
+        export PS1_COLOR="\[\033[0;31m\]"  # Red = danger
+    elif ! git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -q "$SESSION_BRANCH"; then
+        export PS1_COLOR="\[\033[0;33m\]"  # Yellow = warning
+    else
+        export PS1_COLOR="\[\033[0;32m\]"  # Green = good
+    fi
+}
+```
+
+**File Operation Monitoring**:
+```bash
+# Warn when creating files outside worktree
+check_file_location() {
+    local filepath="$1"
+    if [[ ! "$PWD" =~ \.worktrees/ ]]; then
+        echo "WARNING: Creating file outside worktree: $filepath"
+        echo "  Current directory: $PWD"
+        read -p "Continue? (y/N) " -n 1 -r
+        echo
+        [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] && return 1
+    fi
+}
+```
+
+### 3. Create Workflow State Machine
+
+Define session lifecycle as explicit state machine:
+
+```
+States:

+### 5. Documentation Enhancements
+
+**Add to SESSIONS-README.md**:
+- Dedicated "Protocol Compliance" section
+- Validation checkpoint documentation
+- Error recovery procedures
+- Visual workflow diagrams
+
+**Add to SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md**:
+- Complete SOP for each workflow phase
+- Poka-yoke mechanism reference
+- State machine diagram
+- Troubleshooting guide with common violations
+
+## Implementation Priority
+
+1. **Immediate** (Phase 2):
+   - Create four targeted SOPs
+   - Add validation functions to session scripts
+   - Enhance session environment with poka-yoke mechanisms
+
+2. **Short-term** (Phase 3):
+   - Implement state machine validation
+   - Add automated pre-commit/pre-push hooks
+   - Create error recovery documentation
+
+3. **Long-term** (Phase 4):
+   - Develop comprehensive testing suite
+   - Create visual workflow diagrams
+   - Build monitoring and compliance reporting
+
+## Conclusion
+
+The research clearly shows that effective procedural compliance requires **layered defenses**:
+
+1. **Clear Documentation** (SOPs): Define correct procedures explicitly
+2. **Error Prevention** (Poka-yoke): Make errors impossible or difficult
+3. **Error Detection** (Validation): Catch errors immediately when they occur
+4. **Workflow Enforcement** (State machines): Only allow valid transitions
+5. **Recovery Procedures** (SOPs): Provide clear paths to fix violations
+
+Our Agent Sessions Protocol should implement all five layers to ensure consistent adherence to the worktree workflow.

+# Worktree Protocol Investigation: Centering on Passive Restraint Strategy
 
-## Current Protocol Documentation Analysis
+## Executive Summary: The Critical Role of Passive Restraints
+
+This investigation into worktree protocol violations during previous agent sessions reveals a fundamental gap: the absence of **passive restraint mechanisms**. While existing protocol documentation is clear, the agent's consistent failure in execution and decision-making highlights a critical need for always-on, context-aware guidance.
 
-### What the Documentation Actually Says
+**Passive restraints** (e.g., `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`) are configuration files that AI agents automatically consult before taking actions. They act as persistent, project-specific guardrails, embodying "poka-yoke" (error-proofing) principles by making correct behavior easier and incorrect behavior harder. Their absence meant agents relied solely on transient system prompts or reactive validation, leading to:
 
-After reviewing both SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md, the worktree protocol is actually **very clearly documented**:
+-   Working outside the designated worktree.
+-   Creating files in incorrect locations.
+-   Operating on the wrong Git branch.
+
+This document recontextualizes the root causes of protocol violations, emphasizing that **implementing robust passive restraints is the foundational solution** to ensure consistent adherence to the Agent Sessions Protocol.
+
+## Current Protocol Documentation Analysis
+
+The existing documentation (`SESSIONS-README.md` and `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md`) provides clear instructions for worktree usage:

 ### Key Protocol Points That Were Violated
 
-1. **Worktree Creation Timing**: Protocol clearly states worktree should be created **immediately after claiming** (Line 108 in README, Line 45 in REFERENCE)
-
-2. **Working Directory Requirement**: Protocol explicitly states to **"cd .worktrees/{session-slug}"** before activating session environment
+Despite clear documentation, the following protocol points were consistently violated:
 
-3. **Isolation Principle**: Documentation emphasizes worktrees provide "isolated working directories" and "namespace isolation"
+1.  **Worktree Creation Timing**: Worktree was not created immediately after claiming the session.
+2.  **Working Directory Requirement**: Agent failed to `cd .worktrees/{session-slug}` before starting work.
+3.  **Isolation Principle**: Agent did not maintain an isolated working directory, leading to scattered files.
+4.  **Concurrent Session Support**: The agent's actions undermined the ability for multiple concurrent sessions.
 
-4. **Concurrent Session Support**: Protocol designed for "multiple sessions work concurrently" using worktrees
+## Root Cause Analysis: The Absence of Passive Restraints
 
-## Root Cause Analysis: Why Protocol Was Violated
+The primary issue was **Agent Decision-Making Failure**, but this failure was critically exacerbated by the **absence of passive restraint mechanisms**. The protocol documentation is clear, but without persistent, automatic guardrails, the agent consistently failed to follow explicit instructions.
 
-### Primary Issue: **Agent Decision-Making Failure**
-The protocol documentation is **crystal clear** - the failure was in **execution/decision-making**, not documentation clarity. The agent consistently failed to follow explicit instructions regarding worktree usage.
-
-### Specific Decision Points Where Protocol Failed:
+### Specific Decision Points Where Protocol Failed (Exacerbated by Missing Passive Restraints):
 
 1.  **Session Start Decision Point**:
-    -   **Should have**: Created worktree immediately when session started.
-    -   **Actually did**: Worked in main directory, never created worktree initially.
+    -   **Should have**: Created worktree immediately.
+    -   **Actual**: Worked in main directory, never created worktree initially.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Impact**: A `.roo/rules` file could have enforced worktree creation as a prerequisite for any session-related action.
 
 2.  **File Creation Decision Points**:
-    -   **Should have**: Created all session files within worktree directory.
-    -   **Actually did**: Created files scattered across repository root.
+    -   **Should have**: Created all session files within the worktree directory.
+    -   **Actual**: Created files scattered across the repository root.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Impact**: Rules could have prevented file creation outside the designated worktree path.
 
 3.  **Working Directory Decision Points**:
     -   **Should have**: Changed to worktree directory before any work.
-    -   **Actually did**: Stayed in main repository directory.
+    -   **Actual**: Stayed in the main repository directory.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Impact**: Rules could have validated the current working directory before allowing operations.
 
 4.  **Session Environment Activation**:
-    -   **Should have**: Activated session environment from within worktree.
-    -   **Actually did**: Attempted to source environment from wrong location.
-
-## Contributing Factors
-
-### 1. **PWD Anchoring Loss**
--   Agent lost track of current working directory.
--   No validation of current directory before operations.
--   No checks to ensure working in correct location.
-
-### 2. **Missing Validation Steps**
--   No verification that worktree exists before proceeding.
--   No checks that files are being created in correct locations.
--   No confirmation of proper working directory.
-
-### 3. **Protocol Adherence Assumption**
--   Agent assumed it was following protocol without verification.
--   No self-checking mechanisms in place.
--   Lack of protocol compliance validation.
-
-### 4. **Complexity of Multi-Directory Operations**
--   Session requires coordination between multiple directories:
-    -   Main repo (for session metadata)
-    -   Worktree (for actual work)
-    -   Sessions directory (for session files)
--   Agent got confused about which operations happen where.
+    -   **Should have**: Activated session environment from within the worktree.
+    -   **Actual**: Attempted to source environment from the wrong location.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Impact**: Rules could have enforced environment sourcing as a prerequisite for session activity.
 
-### 5. **Agent Operating Outside Session Branch (New Guardrail Issue)**
--   During testing, the agent inadvertently made changes to the `main` branch, violating the "ONLY WORK IN THE SESSION BRANCH" constraint. This indicates a critical need for a mechanism to ensure the agent is always operating within the correct session branch while an active session is in progress.
+### Contributing Factors (Addressed by Passive Restraints)
 
-### 6. **Missing Passive Restraint Mechanisms (Critical Discovery)**
--   The repository lacks passive constraint files (e.g., `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`) that would provide continuous guidance to AI agents.
--   **Passive restraints** are rule files that agents automatically consult before taking actions, similar to how `.editorconfig` enforces coding standards passively.
--   Without these passive restraints, agents rely solely on:
-    -   System prompts (which can be forgotten or overridden)
-    -   Active validation (which must be explicitly invoked)
-    -   User intervention (reactive rather than preventive)
--   This absence likely contributed to protocol violations, as there was no persistent, always-available reference for correct behavior.
--   Passive restraints align with **poka-yoke principles**: they make correct behavior easier and incorrect behavior harder by providing constant guidance.
+1.  **PWD Anchoring Loss**:
+    -   Agent lost track of the current working directory.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Solution**: Rules can enforce `pwd` validation before operations.
 
-## Documentation Gaps Identified
+2.  **Missing Validation Steps**:
+    -   No verification that worktree exists or files are created in correct locations.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Solution**: Rules can define mandatory validation checks for worktree presence, file paths, and branch adherence.
 
-While the protocol is documented, these **enhancements** could prevent future violations:
+3.  **Protocol Adherence Assumption**:
+    -   Agent assumed compliance without verification.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Solution**: Rules provide continuous, automatic self-checking mechanisms.
 
-### 1. **Missing: Explicit Worktree Validation**
-Current docs show **how** to use worktrees but lack **validation** that worktree is being used correctly.
+4.  **Complexity of Multi-Directory Operations**:
+    -   Agent got confused about which operations happen where.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Solution**: Rules simplify decision-making by providing clear, always-available context-specific instructions.
 
-**Needed**: "Verify you're in worktree: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Not in worktree directory'"`
+5.  **Agent Operating Outside Session Branch (New Guardrail Issue)**:
+    -   Agent inadvertently made changes to the `main` branch.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Solution**: Rules can explicitly prohibit operations on non-session branches, acting as a strong preventive measure.
 
-### 2. **Missing: File Location Validation**
-No guidance on ensuring files are created in correct locations.
+## Documentation Gaps Identified (Addressed by Passive Restraints)
 
-**Needed**: "Check file location: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Creating file outside worktree'"`
+The identified documentation "gaps" are not necessarily a lack of *information*, but a lack of *enforcement*. Passive restraints directly address these by embedding the "needed" validations and checks into the agent's operational environment.
 
-### 3. **Missing: Protocol Compliance Checks**
-No self-validation mechanisms mentioned.
+1.  **Missing: Explicit Worktree Validation**:
+    -   **Needed**: "Verify you're in worktree: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Not in worktree directory'"`
+    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: This check can be a rule that automatically runs before file operations.
 
-**Needed**: Regular protocol compliance validation steps.
+2.  **Missing: File Location Validation**:
+    -   **Needed**: "Check file location: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Creating file outside worktree'"`
+    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: A rule can prevent file creation outside the worktree.
 
-### 4. **Missing: Error Recovery Procedures**
-No guidance on what to do if you realize you're not following protocol.
+3.  **Missing: Protocol Compliance Checks**:
+    -   **Needed**: Regular protocol compliance validation steps.
+    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: Rules define these as automatic, continuous checks.
 
-**Needed**: "If you realize you're working outside worktree: [recovery steps]"
+4.  **Missing: Error Recovery Procedures**:
+    -   **Needed**: "If you realize you're working outside worktree: [recovery steps]"
+    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: Rules can include explicit recovery instructions for common violations.
 
-### 5. **Missing: Active Session Branch Validation**
-No explicit check to ensure the agent is operating within the correct session branch. While "Namespace Isolation" is mentioned, the documentation lacks explicit instructions or mechanisms to *enforce* that an agent remains on its session branch.
+5.  **Missing: Active Session Branch Validation**:
+    -   **Needed**: "Verify current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -q 'session/$SESSION_SLUG' || echo 'ERROR: Not in session branch'"`
+    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: A rule can enforce this check before any Git commit/push.
 
-**Needed**: "Verify current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -q 'session/$SESSION_SLUG' || echo 'ERROR: Not in session branch'"`
+## Strategies for Helping the Agent Adhere to the Session Branch (Re-framed by Passive Restraints)
 
-## Strategies for Helping the Agent Adhere to the Session Branch
+The previously identified strategies are all mechanisms that can be *implemented through* or *reinforced by* passive restraints.
 
-To address the newly identified guardrail issue and reinforce adherence to the session branch, the following strategies should be considered:
+1.  **Pre-command Hooks/Aliases**: Can be defined and enforced by passive restraint rules.
+2.  **Environment Variable Enforcement**: Passive restraints can ensure correct environment variable setup and usage.
+3.  **Enhanced Shell Prompt**: Passive restraints can guide the agent to configure a prompt that provides critical context.
+4.  **Automated Context Switching**: Passive restraints can define the conditions and actions for automatic context switching.
+5.  **Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks**: Passive restraints can specify and even generate these Git hooks.
+6.  **Clearer Documentation and Training**: Passive restraints serve as a living, executable form of this documentation.
 
-1.  **Pre-command Hooks/Aliases**: Implement shell functions or aliases that wrap common git commands (`git commit`, `git add`, `git push`) and automatically perform a `validate_in_session_branch` check before execution. If the check fails, the command should be aborted with a clear error message.
-2.  **Environment Variable Enforcement**: Leverage session-specific environment variables (e.g., `SESSION_BRANCH`) to dynamically configure git to only operate on the designated branch, or to warn/error if an attempt is made to switch branches.
-3.  **Enhanced Shell Prompt**: Modify the shell prompt (`PS1`) to prominently display the current branch and a clear indicator if it does not match the active session branch.
-4.  **Automated Context Switching**: Explore mechanisms that automatically switch the agent's working directory and git context to the correct worktree/branch upon session activation, and revert upon deactivation.
-5.  **Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks**: Implement client-side git hooks that prevent commits or pushes from occurring if the agent is not on the correct session branch.
-6.  **Clearer Documentation and Training**: While the protocol is clear, emphasize the "ONLY WORK IN THE SESSION BRANCH" rule with dedicated sections, examples, and warnings in `SESSIONS-README.md` and `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md`.
+## Conclusion: Passive Restraints as the Foundational Solution
 
-## Conclusion
+The core Agent Sessions Protocol is sound, but the failure was in **execution and decision-making** due to a lack of **continuous, automatic enforcement**. The solution is not merely more documentation or reactive validation, but the proactive implementation of **passive restraint mechanisms**.
 
-**The protocol documentation is actually excellent and comprehensive.** The failure was in **execution and decision-making**, not documentation clarity. The solution is to:
+By centering our strategy on passive restraints, we can:
 
-1.  **Add validation mechanisms** to prevent protocol violations.
-2.  **Enhance documentation** with explicit validation steps.
-3.  **Create safeguards** that make protocol violations impossible or easily detectable.
-4.  **Implement recovery procedures** for when violations are detected.
-5.  **Specifically enforce adherence to the session branch** through technical and procedural safeguards.
+1.  **Embed Protocol Rules**: Make session workflow requirements an inherent part of the agent's operational environment.
+2.  **Prevent Violations**: Leverage poka-yoke principles to make incorrect actions impossible or immediately obvious.
+3.  **Ensure Consistent Adherence**: Provide always-on guidance that transcends individual session prompts.
+4.  **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Simplify decision-making by providing clear, context-specific rules.
+5.  **Enable Self-Correction**: Equip agents with the means to validate their own actions against established protocols.
 
-The core protocol is sound - we just need better **enforcement and validation** mechanisms, with a particular focus on ensuring the agent operates exclusively within its assigned session branch.

+# SOP Research Findings: Optimizing Procedural Guidance for LLM Agents
+
+## Executive Summary
+
+This document presents updated findings and recommendations for creating effective Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) tailored for Large Language Model (LLM) agents within the Agent Sessions Protocol. Building upon previous research into procedural compliance and error prevention, this version integrates best practices for "chunking" and structuring information to maximize LLM comprehension, accuracy, and adherence. Key insights include:
+
+1.  **Strategic Chunking**: Breaking down SOPs into semantically coherent, manageable segments to fit LLM context windows and improve retrieval.
+2.  **Structured SOP Representation**: Transforming natural language SOPs into structured formats (e.g., decision trees, DAGs) for enhanced LLM reasoning.
+3.  **LLM-Friendly Language**: Using clear, unambiguous, and action-oriented language to minimize misinterpretation by agents.
+4.  **Integrated Error-Proofing (Poka-Yoke)**: Designing SOPs and workflows with built-in mechanisms to prevent or detect deviations, leveraging chunking and structured data.
+5.  **Automated Validation & Enforcement**: Implementing checkpoints and guardrails that are compatible with LLM processing of structured SOPs.
+
+## 1. The Challenge: LLMs and Complex Procedures
+
+Large Language Models excel at understanding and generating human-like text, but they face inherent limitations when processing lengthy, complex procedural documents like SOPs:
+
+*   **Token Limits**: LLMs have finite context windows, restricting the amount of text they can process at once. Long SOPs must be broken down.
+*   **Contextual Drift**: Overly long inputs can lead to LLMs losing focus or misinterpreting context within a procedure.
+*   **Ambiguity in Natural Language**: SOPs often contain vague terms or implicit steps that humans understand but LLMs may struggle to interpret consistently, leading to errors.
+*   **Lack of Structured Reasoning**: While LLMs can follow instructions, they perform better when procedures are presented in a structured, logical format that facilitates explicit reasoning paths.
+
+To overcome these challenges, SOPs for LLM agents require deliberate design, focusing on how information is segmented and represented.
+
+## 2. Strategic Chunking for LLM-Driven SOPs
+
+Chunking is the process of dividing large documents into smaller, semantically meaningful segments ("chunks") that fit within an LLM's context window and optimize information retrieval.
+
+### Why Chunking is Essential:
+
+*   **Context Window Management**: Ensures that all relevant information for a specific step or decision fits within the LLM's processing capacity.
+*   **Improved Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: When using RAG systems, smaller, focused chunks lead to more precise retrieval of relevant procedural steps, reducing noise and improving response accuracy.
+*   **Reduced Hallucinations**: By providing concise, relevant chunks, the LLM is less likely to generate incorrect or irrelevant information.
+*   **Cost and Latency Optimization**: Smaller inputs generally lead to faster processing and lower computational costs.
+
+### Key Chunking Strategies:
+
+1.  **Fixed-Size Chunking**:
+    *   **Description**: Divides text into segments of a predetermined character or token count, often with a fixed overlap.
+    *   **Pros**: Simple to implement, guarantees chunks fit context window.
+    *   **Cons**: Can arbitrarily cut across sentences or paragraphs, potentially breaking semantic coherence.
+
+2.  **Sentence Chunking**:
+    *   **Description**: Splits text at natural sentence boundaries. Libraries like NLTK or spaCy can be used for robust sentence segmentation.
+    *   **Pros**: Preserves semantic integrity at the sentence level, better context than fixed-size.
+    *   **Cons**: Sentences can still be too long or too short, and a single sentence might not provide enough context for a complex step.
+
+3.  **Recursive Chunking**:
+    *   **Description**: Attempts to split text using a hierarchy of delimiters (e.g., first by paragraphs, then by sentences, then by words) until chunks meet a size criterion.
+    *   **Pros**: Aims to maintain semantic coherence by prioritizing larger logical units before breaking them down further.
+    *   **Cons**: Can still result in chunks that lack complete procedural context if logical steps span multiple paragraphs.
+
+4.  **Semantic Chunking (LLM-Assisted/Agentic Chunking)**:
+    *   **Description**: Uses embeddings or an LLM itself to identify and group semantically related sentences or paragraphs into chunks. An LLM can act as an "agent" to determine optimal chunk boundaries based on the content's meaning.
+    *   **Pros**: Creates highly relevant and contextually rich chunks, ideal for complex SOPs where logical steps might not align with simple structural breaks.
+    *   **Cons**: More computationally intensive, requires an additional LLM call or embedding model.
+
+### Optimizing Chunking for SOPs:
+
+*   **Context-Aware Segmentation**: Prioritize breaking SOPs at logical procedural steps, headings, or sub-sections rather than arbitrary character counts. Each chunk should ideally represent a complete, actionable instruction or a distinct sub-procedure.
+*   **Overlap**: Implement a small overlap between sequential chunks to ensure continuity and prevent loss of context at chunk boundaries.
+*   **Metadata Enrichment**: Attach relevant metadata to each chunk (e.g., section title, step number, prerequisites, responsible role, expected output). This metadata can be used by the LLM to better understand the chunk's context and purpose.
+*   **Adaptive Chunk Size**: Experiment with chunk sizes. While smaller chunks are cheaper, larger chunks might be necessary to capture the full context of a complex procedural step. The optimal size depends on the LLM's context window and the complexity of the SOP.
+
+## 3. Structuring SOPs for LLM Comprehension
+
+Beyond chunking, the inherent structure of an SOP significantly impacts an LLM's ability to follow it accurately. Transforming natural language SOPs into structured representations enhances LLM reasoning and reduces ambiguity.
+
+### Key Principles for LLM-Friendly SOP Structure:
+
+1.  **Clarity and Specificity**:
+    *   **Action-Oriented Language**: Use imperative verbs (e.g., "Click," "Verify," "Input") to clearly define actions.
+    *   **Avoid Ambiguity**: Eliminate vague terms ("periodically," "typically," "should"). Replace with quantifiable or explicit instructions.
+    *   **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Break down tasks into discrete, numbered steps.
+    *   **Visual Aids (Conceptual)**: While LLMs don't "see" images, the *concept* of a flowchart or diagram can guide the structured representation.
+
+2.  **Formalized Structure**:
+    *   **Decision-Tree-Based Representation**: Convert conditional logic within SOPs into explicit decision points and branches. This allows LLMs to follow clear `IF-THEN-ELSE` paths.
+    *   **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Format**: Represent complex workflows as a series of nodes (steps) and edges (transitions), capturing logical and temporal dependencies. This is ideal for processes with parallel steps or multiple valid paths.
+    *   **JSON/YAML Representation**: For critical parameters or configuration, represent them in structured data formats that LLMs can parse reliably.
+
+3.  **Standardized Components**:
+    *   **Purpose and Scope**: Clearly define the SOP's objective and boundaries.
+    *   **Responsibilities**: Explicitly state which agent or role is responsible for each step.
+    *   **Prerequisites**: List all conditions or resources required before a step can begin.
+    *   **Expected Outcomes/Validation Points**: Define what constitutes a successful completion of a step and how it should be validated.
+    *   **Error Handling/Recovery**: Provide explicit instructions for what to do if a step fails or an error occurs.
+
+## 4. Poka-Yoke (Error-Proofing) Mechanisms in LLM-Driven Workflows
+
+Poka-yoke principles, traditionally applied to human processes, are critical for LLM agents to prevent or detect errors. Strategic chunking and structured SOPs inherently contribute to these mechanisms.
+
+### How Chunking & Structure Enhance Poka-Yoke:
+
+*   **Prevention (Control Type)**:
+    *   **Structured Input**: By providing SOPs in a decision-tree or DAG format, the LLM is guided through valid transitions, making invalid actions less likely.
+    *   **Explicit Prerequisites**: Chunks containing clear prerequisites act as guards, preventing the LLM from attempting a step before conditions are met.
+    *   **Token Limits as a Guard**: Proper chunking ensures the LLM receives only relevant context, preventing it from "inventing" steps due to an overwhelming or incomplete input.
+
+*   **Detection (Warning Type)**:
+    *   **Defined Validation Points**: Each chunk can specify an expected outcome or validation check, allowing the LLM to self-assess or trigger external validation.
+    *   **Metadata for Anomaly Detection**: Metadata (e.g., "expected output format") can be used to detect deviations in the LLM's generated actions or responses.
+    *   **Error Recovery Chunks**: Dedicated chunks or sections for error recovery provide the LLM with explicit instructions on how to respond to detected issues.
+
+## 5. Workflow State Machines and Validation for LLM Agents
+
+State machines provide a robust framework for managing the lifecycle of agent sessions, and their effectiveness is amplified by structured, chunked SOPs.
+
+### State Machine Patterns with LLM Integration:
+
+*   **States**: Discrete stages of an agent session (e.g., "Planning," "Active Worktree," "Review," "Completion").
+*   **Transitions**: Valid movements between states, explicitly defined in the SOP.
+*   **Guards (LLM-Interpretable)**: Conditions that must be met for transitions, expressed in a way that LLMs can evaluate (e.g., "IF all changes committed THEN proceed"). These guards can reference metadata from SOP chunks.
+*   **Actions (LLM-Executable)**: Operations performed during transitions, which the LLM agent can execute (e.g., "create pull request," "move session to completed folder").
+
+### Validation Checkpoints Enhanced by Chunking:
+
+*   **Pre-transition Validation**: LLMs can evaluate guard conditions by referencing specific SOP chunks that define prerequisites for state changes.
+*   **Post-transition Validation**: After an LLM agent performs an action, subsequent SOP chunks can define validation steps to confirm the new state's validity.
+*   **Checkpoint Persistence**: The state of the agent session (and the current SOP step) should be persistently recorded, allowing for recovery and audit.
+
+## 6. Automated Guardrails and Enforcement for Agent Sessions
+
+Automated guardrails are crucial for ensuring LLM agents adhere to the Agent Sessions Protocol, preventing deviations and enforcing best practices.
+
+### Guardrail Patterns for LLM Agents:
+
+*   **Pre-execution Validation**:
+    *   **Pre-command Hooks**: Scripts that run before an LLM agent executes a command (e.g., `git commit`), checking against SOP rules (e.g., "Is the agent on the correct session branch?").
+    *   **Environment Checks**: Validating the agent's current working directory or sourced environment variables against SOP requirements.
+*   **In-process Monitoring**:
+    *   **Periodic Validation**: Regularly checking the agent's state (branch, directory) against the active SOP.
+    *   **Anomaly Detection**: Flagging deviations from expected behavior based on the structured SOP.
+*   **Post-execution Verification**:
+    *   **Output Validation**: Verifying that the LLM agent's actions or generated content align with the expected outcomes defined in the SOP chunks.
+    *   **Audit Trails**: Maintaining a detailed log of all agent actions, decisions, and state transitions, linked to the executed SOP steps.
+
+### Enforcement Mechanisms:
+
+*   **Blocking Operations**: Prevent invalid actions (e.g., blocking a `git commit` if not on the session branch).
+*   **Warning Systems**: Alerting the agent or user to potential issues (e.g., "WARNING: Creating file outside worktree").
+*   **Automated Correction**: For minor, predictable errors, the system could automatically correct the agent's action based on SOP guidance.
+
+## 7. Critical Discovery: Missing Passive Restraints (Revisited)
+
+The absence of passive restraint mechanisms (e.g., `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`) remains a critical gap. These files serve as persistent, project-specific guidance that LLM agents automatically consult, embodying poka-yoke principles.
+
+### How Passive Restraints Complement Chunking & Structured SOPs:
+
+*   **Persistent Rule Repository**: Passive restraints provide a stable, version-controlled source of rules that complement the dynamic nature of SOP execution.
+*   **Automatic Enforcement**: Agents can be configured to check these rules before any operation, acting as an immediate, low-level guardrail.
+*   **Context for LLMs**: These rules can be provided as additional context to the LLM, reinforcing critical behavioral constraints.
+
+### Recommendation: Implement Passive Restraints
+
+The recommendation to create `.roo/rules` (or equivalent) with session protocol requirements is reinforced. This file should:
+
+*   Define session workflow requirements clearly.
+*   List prohibited operations during active sessions.
+*   Specify required validations before actions.
+*   Provide error recovery procedures.
+*   Be checked into version control (main branch) and automatically copied to worktrees.
+
+## 8. Recommendations for Agent Sessions Protocol
+
+To ensure robust and compliant agent sessions, the protocol should integrate strategic chunking, structured SOP representation, and enhanced error-proofing.
+
+### 8.1. Create Passive Restraint Files (CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE)
+
+*   **Action**: Create a `.roo/rules` file in the repository root with the core session protocol requirements.
+*   **Content**: Include rules for branch adherence, worktree usage, prohibited operations, and required validations.
+*   **Integration**: Ensure agents are configured to automatically consult this file before executing commands.
+
+### 8.2. Develop LLM-Optimized Procedural SOPs
+
+Instead of monolithic documents, create modular, LLM-friendly SOPs:
+
+#### **SOP-001: Session Creation and Initialization (Structured Checklist)**
+*   **Format**: Step-by-step guide, potentially represented as a JSON or YAML checklist for LLM parsing.
+*   **Key Elements**: Each step should be a distinct chunk with clear actions, expected outcomes, and validation points.
+*   **Example Chunk**:
+    ```json
+    {
+      "step": 1,
+      "action": "Create session metadata in drafting folder",
+      "validation": "Verify session directory structure created",
+      "responsible": "Agent"
+    }
+    ```
+
+#### **SOP-002: Active Session Operations (Contextual Reference Guide)**
+*   **Format**: A collection of context-aware chunks, each detailing a specific operational rule or sub-procedure.
+*   **Key Elements**: Rules should be explicit, with associated poka-yoke mechanisms.
+*   **Example Chunk**:
+    ```json
+    {
+      "rule_id": "OP-003",
+      "description": "ALWAYS work exclusively within the session's worktree directory.",
+      "poka_yoke_type": "Prevention",
+      "mechanism": "Pre-command hook: validate_in_worktree()",
+      "error_recovery": "cd .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
+    }
+    ```
+
+#### **SOP-003: Session Completion and Integration (State Transition Guide)**
+*   **Format**: A sequence of state transitions, with each transition defined by a set of actions and guards. Can be represented as a DAG.
+*   **Key Elements**: Each transition is a chunk, detailing actions, required validations, and the next valid state.
+
+#### **SOP-004: Error Recovery and Protocol Violations (Decision Tree)**
+*   **Format**: A decision tree or conditional logic structure, guiding the LLM agent through recovery steps based on detected errors.
+*   **Key Elements**: Each node in the tree is a chunk, representing an error scenario, a decision point, or a recovery action.
+
+### 8.3. Implement Poka-Yoke Error-Proofing (Enhanced)
+
+*   **Branch Protection**: Integrate `validate_session_branch()` into pre-command hooks for `git commit` and `git push`.
+*   **Working Directory Protection**: Implement `validate_in_worktree()` for file operations.
+*   **Enhanced Shell Prompt**: Update `PS1` to visually indicate current branch and worktree status.
+*   **File Operation Monitoring**: Implement checks to warn or block file creation outside the worktree.
+
+### 8.4. Enhance Session Scripts with Validation
+
+*   **Update `claim-session` script**: Incorporate comprehensive validation checkpoints for branch creation, worktree setup, and session activation.
+*   **Session Environment File (`.session-env`)**: Include validation functions and enhanced prompt settings directly in the sourced environment.
+
+### 8.5. Documentation Enhancements
+
+*   **SESSIONS-README.md**: Add a dedicated "LLM Agent Protocol Compliance" section, detailing the importance of chunking, structured SOPs, and error-proofing.
+*   **SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md**: Provide complete, LLM-optimized SOPs for each workflow phase, including chunking strategies, structured representations, and detailed poka-yoke mechanisms.
+
+## Conclusion
+
+Effective management of LLM agents in complex workflows like the Agent Sessions Protocol hinges on providing them with clear, unambiguous, and contextually relevant instructions. By adopting strategic chunking and structured SOP representations, combined with robust error-proofing and automated guardrails, we can significantly enhance agent reliability, reduce errors, and ensure consistent protocol adherence. The implementation of passive restraint files is a critical first step to embed these principles directly into the agent's operational environment.

+*   **Semantic Chunking Implementations**: Research methods for implementing LLM-assisted or embedding-based semantic chunking to ensure logical coherence.
+*   **Structured Data Formats**: Evaluate different structured data formats (e.g., JSON, YAML, custom markdown structures) for representing SOPs as decision trees or DAGs that are easily parsable by LLMs.
+*   **Integration with Agent Workflow**: Explore how to best integrate the chunked and structured SOPs into the existing agent workflow, including how agents will retrieve and interpret relevant chunks at each step.
+*   **Poka-Yoke Mechanism Integration**: Research how to effectively embed the enhanced poka-yoke mechanisms (branch protection, directory validation, etc.) directly into the SOPs and agent execution environment.
+*   **Passive Restraint Implementation**: Investigate best practices for creating and integrating `.roo/rules` or similar passive restraint files to enforce protocol adherence.
+
+## Implementation Plan (To be detailed)
+
+This section will be detailed once the research phase is complete and a preferred strategy is identified. It will outline the steps for:
+
+1.  Creating the `.roo/rules` file.
+2.  Developing templates or tools for generating chunked and structured SOPs.
+3.  Modifying existing session scripts (`claim-session`, `complete-session`) to incorporate SOP validation and error-proofing.
+4.  Implementing new agent behaviors for interacting with chunked SOPs.
+5.  Testing and validating the new system.
+
+## Dependencies
+
+*   Completion of `2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol` session and finalization of `sop-research-findings.md`.
+
+## Notes
+
+This session is currently in the drafting phase and should not be started until explicitly instructed. The primary goal of this draft is to capture the intent and initial research directions.

-### 2. Poka-Yoke (Error-Proofing) Mechanisms
-
-#### Core Principles (Source: ASQ, Kaizen, Six Sigma Daily)
-
-**Poka-yoke** (Japanese: ポカヨケ, "mistake-proofing") is any mechanism that helps prevent errors or makes them immediately obvious when they occur.
-
-**Two Main Categories**:
-
-1. **Prevention (Control) Type**: Makes errors impossible
-   - Physical constraints that prevent incorrect assembly
-   - System locks that block invalid operations
-   - Interlocks that require prerequisite conditions
-   - Example: Car manual transmission requiring clutch press to start
-   - Example: Automatic transmission requiring "Park" or "Neutral" to start
-
-2. **Detection (Warning) Type**: Makes errors immediately visible
-   - Visual indicators (lights, colors, displays)
-   - Audible alarms and alerts
-   - System warnings and error messages
-   - Example: Form validation preventing submission until all fields complete
-   - Example: Password confirmation requiring matching entries
-
-**Six Essential Principles** (Source: Creately, Cleverence)
-
-1. **Elimination**: Design processes to eliminate error opportunities
-2. **Replacement**: Replace error-prone steps with more reliable methods
-3. **Facilitation**: Make correct execution easier than incorrect execution
-4. **Detection**: Identify errors immediately when they occur
-5. **Mitigation**: Reduce the impact of errors that do occur
-6. **Recovery**: Provide clear paths to correct errors when detected

-### 3. Workflow State Machines and Validation
-
-#### State Machine Patterns (Source: Symfony, Microsoft, ManageIQ)
-
-**Core Concepts**:
-- **States**: Discrete stages in a workflow (e.g., "draft," "review," "approved")
-- **Transitions**: Valid movements between states
-- **Guards**: Conditions that must be met for transitions
-- **Actions**: Operations performed during transitions
-- **Validation**: Checks ensuring state/transition validity
-
-**State Machine Workflow Characteristics**:
-- Finite number of well-defined states
-- Explicit transitions between states
-- Entry/exit actions for each state
-- Pre/post-processing around state changes
-- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
-- Checkpoint persistence (saves state after each transition)
-
-**Validation Checkpoints** (Source: Google Cloud Workflows, AWS Step Functions)
-- **Pre-transition validation**: Verify current state before allowing transition
-- **Guard conditions**: Check prerequisites are met
-- **Post-transition validation**: Confirm new state is valid
-- **Checkpoint persistence**: Save state after successful transitions
-- **Rollback capability**: Revert to previous state on error
-
-### 4. Automated Guardrails and Enforcement
-
-#### Guardrail Patterns (Source: AWS Bedrock, GitGuardian, Jira/Restack)
-
-**Pre-execution Validation**:
-- **Pre-commit hooks**: Run checks before code enters repository
-- **Pre-flight checks**: Validate environment before workflow starts
-- **Prerequisite verification**: Confirm required resources exist
-
-**In-process Monitoring**:
-- **Checkpoint validation**: Verify state at critical workflow points
-- **Real-time monitoring**: Track workflow execution metrics
-- **Anomaly detection**: Flag deviations from expected behavior
-
-**Post-execution Verification**:
-- **Output validation**: Verify workflow results meet criteria
-- **Compliance reporting**: Document adherence to procedures
-- **Audit trails**: Maintain complete workflow history
-
-**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
-- **Blocking operations**: Prevent invalid actions from occurring
-- **Warning systems**: Alert operators to potential issues
-- **Automated correction**: Fix common errors automatically
-- **Circuit breakers**: Stop workflows when critical errors detected
-
-## Critical Discovery: Missing Passive Restraints
-
-During the investigation, a critical gap was identified: **the repository lacks passive restraint mechanisms** such as `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`, or similar AI agent guidance files.
-
-### What Are Passive Restraints?
-
-Passive restraints are configuration files that AI coding agents automatically consult before taking actions. They serve as:
-
-- **Persistent rule repositories**: Always available, not dependent on system prompts
-- **Project-specific guidance**: Tailored to the specific workflow and constraints
-- **Automatic enforcement**: Agents check these before operations
-- **Documentation**: Human-readable reference for correct behavior
-
-### Examples of Passive Restraint Systems
-
-**Roo/Cline** (`.roo/rules`):
-- Project-specific rules and constraints
-- File editing policies
-- Branch protection rules
-- Workflow requirements
-
-**Cursor** (`.cursorrules`):
-- Coding standards and practices
-- Prohibited operations
-- Required validations
-- Project structure rules
-
-**EditorConfig** (`.editorconfig`):
-- Formatting standards
-- File encoding rules
-- Line ending conventions
-
-### How Passive Restraints Prevent Protocol Violations
-
-Passive restraints embody **poka-yoke principles**:
-
-1. **Prevention**: Rules prevent incorrect actions before they occur
-2. **Detection**: Violations are flagged immediately
-3. **Guidance**: Clear instructions for correct behavior
-4. **Consistency**: Same rules apply regardless of agent instance
-5. **Persistence**: Rules survive across sessions and conversations
-
-### Missing Restraints as Root Cause
-
-The absence of passive restraints likely contributed to protocol violations because:
-
-- Agents relied solely on system prompts (can be forgotten/overridden)
-- No automatic validation of branch/directory operations
-- No persistent reference for session workflow requirements
-- Lack of preventive mechanisms for common mistakes
-
-### Recommendation: Implement Passive Restraints
-
-Create `.roo/rules` (or equivalent) with session protocol requirements:
-
-```markdown
-# Agent Sessions Protocol Rules
-
-## CRITICAL: Session Branch Adherence
-
-When an active session exists in `_AGENTS/sessions/active/`:
-- MUST work exclusively in session branch `session/{session-slug}`
-- MUST work in worktree directory `.worktrees/{session-slug}`
-- MUST NOT commit to main, dev, or any non-session branch
-- MUST NOT create files outside worktree when session active
-
-## Session Workflow Requirements
-
-### Before Starting Work:
-1. Verify session claimed (exists in `_AGENTS/sessions/active/`)
-2. Verify on correct session branch: `git branch --show-current`
-3. Verify in worktree directory: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/'`
-4. Verify session environment sourced: `echo $SESSION_SLUG`
-
-### During Active Session:
-- All file operations within `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`
-- All git operations on `session/{session-slug}` branch
-- Regular validation of PWD and branch
-- Update worklog.md with progress
-
-### Before Completing Session:
-- All work committed to session branch
-- Session branch pushed to remote
-- Worktree cleaned up
-- Session moved to completed/
-
-## Prohibited Operations During Active Session
-
-- ❌ Switching to main/dev branches
-- ❌ Creating files in repository root
-- ❌ Committing to non-session branches
-- ❌ Working outside worktree directory
-- ❌ Modifying files on main branch
-
-## Required Validations
-
-Before any git commit:
-- Verify on session branch
-- Verify in worktree directory
-- Verify git identity set correctly
-
-Before any file creation:
-- Verify PWD is in worktree
-- Verify file path is within worktree
-
-Before session completion:
-- Verify all changes committed
-- Verify session branch pushed
-- Verify worklog.md updated
-```
-
-## Recommendations for Agent Sessions Protocol
-
-### 1. Create Passive Restraint Files (CRITICAL - NEW)
-
-**Priority: Immediate**
-
-Create `.roo/rules` or equivalent passive restraint file that:
-- Defines session workflow requirements clearly
-- Lists prohibited operations during active sessions
-- Specifies required validations before actions
-- Provides error recovery procedures
-- Includes examples of correct vs incorrect behavior
-
-This file should be:
-- Checked into version control (main branch)
-- Automatically copied to worktrees
-- Updated as protocol evolves
-- Referenced in all session documentation
-
-### 2. Create Targeted Procedural SOPs
-
-Based on the research, we should create four distinct SOPs for the Agent Sessions Protocol workflow:
-
-#### **SOP-001: Session Creation and Initialization**
-- **Format**: Step-by-step checklist with validation checkpoints
-- **Scope**: From session planning to session activation
-- **Key Steps**:
-  1. Create session metadata in drafting folder
-  2. **VALIDATION**: Verify session directory structure created
-  3. Claim session (move to planned/active)
-  4. Create session branch from appropriate base
-  5. **VALIDATION**: Verify on correct branch
-  6. Create worktree for session
-  7. **VALIDATION**: Verify worktree directory exists
-  8. Switch to worktree directory
-  9. **VALIDATION**: Verify PWD is in worktree
-  10. Source session environment
-  11. **VALIDATION**: Verify environment variables set
-  12. Begin work
-
-#### **SOP-002: Active Session Operations**
-- **Format**: Reference guide with poka-yoke mechanisms
-- **Scope**: All operations during active session work
-- **Key Rules**:
-  - ALWAYS work in worktree directory
-  - NEVER switch to main/dev branches during session
-  - ONLY commit to session branch
-  - Validate PWD before file operations
-  - Validate branch before git operations
-  - Use session-specific git identity
-
-#### **SOP-003: Session Completion and Integration**
-- **Format**: Step-by-step checklist with state transitions
-- **Scope**: From work completion to session archival
-- **Key Steps**:
-  1. Finalize all session work
-  2. **VALIDATION**: Verify all changes committed
-  3. Push session branch to remote
-  4. **VALIDATION**: Verify push succeeded
-  5. Create merge/pull request if needed
-  6. Complete session (move to completed folder)
-  7. **VALIDATION**: Verify session metadata updated
-  8. Clean up worktree
-  9. **VALIDATION**: Verify worktree removed
-  10. Archive session documentation
-
-#### **SOP-004: Error Recovery and Protocol Violations**
-- **Format**: Decision tree with recovery procedures
-- **Scope**: Handling protocol violations and errors
-- **Scenarios**:
-  - Working in wrong directory → Recovery steps
-  - On wrong branch → Recovery steps
-  - Files in wrong location → Recovery steps
-  - Worktree not created → Recovery steps
-  - Session environment not sourced → Recovery steps
-
-### 2. Implement Poka-Yoke Error-Proofing
-
-#### **Prevention Mechanisms** (Block errors before they occur)
-
-**Branch Protection**:
-```bash
-# Add to .session-env
-# Lock current branch for session duration
-export SESSION_BRANCH="session/$(basename $SESSION_DIR)"
-export GIT_BRANCH_CHECK="always"
-
-# Pre-command validation function
-validate_session_branch() {
-    local current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
-    if [[ "$current_branch" != "$SESSION_BRANCH" ]]; then
-        echo "ERROR: Not on session branch!"
-        echo "  Current: $current_branch"
-        echo "  Expected: $SESSION_BRANCH"
-        echo "  Run: git checkout $SESSION_BRANCH"
-        return 1
-    fi
-}
-```
-
-**Working Directory Protection**:
-```bash
-# Verify in worktree before file operations
-validate_in_worktree() {
-    if [[ ! "$PWD" =~ \.worktrees/ ]]; then
-        echo "ERROR: Not in worktree directory!"
-        echo "  Current: $PWD"
-        echo "  Expected: .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG/"
-        echo "  Run: cd .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
-        return 1
-    fi
-}
-```
-
-**Git Operation Wrapping**:
-```bash
-# Wrap git commands with validation
-git() {
-    # Validate branch before commits/pushes
-    if [[ "$1" == "commit" ]] || [[ "$1" == "push" ]]; then
-        validate_session_branch || return 1
-    fi
-    
-    # Call actual git
-    command git "$@"
-}
-```
-
-#### **Detection Mechanisms** (Make errors immediately visible)
-
-**Enhanced Shell Prompt**:
-```bash
-# Show branch and worktree status in prompt
-export PS1='[\u@\h \W $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)]$(pwd | grep -q ".worktrees" && echo " [WORKTREE]" || echo " [MAIN]")\$ '
-```
-
-**Periodic Validation**:
-```bash
-# Add to .session-env
-# Run validation every few commands
-export PROMPT_COMMAND="validate_session_state"
-
-validate_session_state() {
-    # Silent validation, just update prompt color
-    if ! pwd | grep -q ".worktrees"; then
-        export PS1_COLOR="\[\033[0;31m\]"  # Red = danger
-    elif ! git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -q "$SESSION_BRANCH"; then
-        export PS1_COLOR="\[\033[0;33m\]"  # Yellow = warning
-    else
-        export PS1_COLOR="\[\033[0;32m\]"  # Green = good
-    fi
-}
-```
-
-**File Operation Monitoring**:
-```bash
-# Warn when creating files outside worktree
-check_file_location() {
-    local filepath="$1"
-    if [[ ! "$PWD" =~ \.worktrees/ ]]; then
-        echo "WARNING: Creating file outside worktree: $filepath"
-        echo "  Current directory: $PWD"
-        read -p "Continue? (y/N) " -n 1 -r
-        echo
-        [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]] && return 1
-    fi
-}
-```
-
-### 3. Create Workflow State Machine
-
-Define session lifecycle as explicit state machine:
-
-```
-States:
-  - DRAFTING: Session being planned
-  - PLANNED: Session defined, ready to start
-  - ACTIVE: Session claimed, work in progress
-  - COMPLETING: Work done, preparing for integration
-  - COMPLETED: Session archived, fully integrated
-
-Valid Transitions:
-  DRAFTING → PLANNED (when SESSION.md complete)
-  PLANNED → ACTIVE (when session claimed)
-  ACTIVE → COMPLETING (when work finalized)
-  COMPLETING → COMPLETED (when integrated and archived)
-  
-  Error transitions:
-  ACTIVE → PLANNED (abort session, rollback)
-  COMPLETING → ACTIVE (found issues, resume work)
-
-Guards (preconditions for transitions):
-  DRAFTING → PLANNED:
-    - SESSION.md exists and complete
-    - Implementation plan defined
-    
-  PLANNED → ACTIVE:
-    - Session branch created
-    - Worktree exists
-    - In worktree directory
-    - Session environment sourced
-    
-  ACTIVE → COMPLETING:
-    - All work committed
-    - On session branch
-    - Worktree clean
-    
-  COMPLETING → COMPLETED:
-    - Changes pushed to remote
-    - Session metadata updated
-    - Worktree cleaned up
-```
-
-### 4. Enhance Session Scripts with Validation
-
-**Update `claim-session` script**:
-```bash
-#!/bin/bash
-
-# Session claiming with comprehensive validation
-
-set -e
-
-SESSION_SLUG="$1"
-[[ -z "$SESSION_SLUG" ]] && echo "Usage: claim-session <session-slug>" && exit 1
-
-# Validate session exists in planned
-[[ ! -d "_AGENTS/sessions/planned/$SESSION_SLUG" ]] && \
-    echo "ERROR: Session not found in planned/" && exit 1
-
-# Create session branch
-echo "Creating session branch..."
-git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG" || exit 1
-
-# VALIDATION CHECKPOINT
-current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
-[[ "$current_branch" != "session/$SESSION_SLUG" ]] && \
-    echo "ERROR: Failed to create session branch" && exit 1
-
-# Create worktree
-echo "Creating worktree..."
-git worktree add -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG" \
-    ".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG" \
-    HEAD || exit 1
-
-# VALIDATION CHECKPOINT
-[[ ! -d ".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG" ]] && \
-    echo "ERROR: Worktree directory not created" && exit 1
-
-# Move session to active
-echo "Activating session..."
-mv "_AGENTS/sessions/planned/$SESSION_SLUG" \
-   "_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG" || exit 1
-
-# VALIDATION CHECKPOINT
-[[ ! -d "_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG" ]] && \
-    echo "ERROR: Session not in active/" && exit 1
-
-# Create session environment file
-cat > "_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG/.session-env" <<EOF
-# Session Environment for $SESSION_SLUG
-export SESSION_SLUG="$SESSION_SLUG"
-export SESSION_DIR="\$PWD"
-export SESSION_BRANCH="session/$SESSION_SLUG"
-export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Agent-$SESSION_SLUG"
-export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="agent-$SESSION_SLUG@sessions.local"
-export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="\$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
-export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="\$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
-
-# Validation functions
-validate_session_branch() {
-    local current=\$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
-    [[ "\$current" != "\$SESSION_BRANCH" ]] && \
-        echo "ERROR: Not on session branch (current: \$current)" && return 1
-    return 0
-}
-
-validate_in_worktree() {
-    [[ ! "\$PWD" =~ \.worktrees/ ]] && \
-        echo "ERROR: Not in worktree directory" && return 1
-    return 0
-}
-
-# Enhanced prompt
-export PS1='[\u@\h \W \$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)]\$ '
-
-# Git command wrapper
-git() {
-    if [[ "\$1" == "commit" ]] || [[ "\$1" == "push" ]]; then
-        validate_session_branch || return 1
-    fi
-    command git "\$@"
-}
-EOF
-
-# Instructions
-echo ""
-echo "✓ Session claimed successfully!"
-echo ""
-echo "Next steps:"
-echo "  1. cd .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
-echo "  2. source ../../sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG/.session-env"
-echo "  3. Begin work (you are now in isolated worktree on session branch)"
-echo ""
-
-# FINAL VALIDATION
-echo "Running final validation..."
-[[ ! -f ".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG/.git" ]] && \
-    echo "ERROR: Worktree .git file missing" && exit 1
-    
-echo "✓ All validation checks passed"
-```
-
-### 5. Documentation Enhancements
-
-**Add to SESSIONS-README.md**:
-- Dedicated "Protocol Compliance" section
-- Validation checkpoint documentation
-- Error recovery procedures
-- Visual workflow diagrams
-
-**Add to SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md**:
-- Complete SOP for each workflow phase
-- Poka-yoke mechanism reference
-- State machine diagram
-- Troubleshooting guide with common violations
-
-## Implementation Priority
-
-1. **Immediate** (Phase 2):
-   - Create four targeted SOPs
-   - Add validation functions to session scripts
-   - Enhance session environment with poka-yoke mechanisms
-
-2. **Short-term** (Phase 3):
-   - Implement state machine validation
-   - Add automated pre-commit/pre-push hooks
-   - Create error recovery documentation
-
-3. **Long-term** (Phase 4):
-   - Develop comprehensive testing suite
-   - Create visual workflow diagrams
-   - Build monitoring and compliance reporting
-
-## Conclusion
-
-The research clearly shows that effective procedural compliance requires **layered defenses**:
-
-1. **Clear Documentation** (SOPs): Define correct procedures explicitly
-2. **Error Prevention** (Poka-yoke): Make errors impossible or difficult
-3. **Error Detection** (Validation): Catch errors immediately when they occur
-4. **Workflow Enforcement** (State machines): Only allow valid transitions
-5. **Recovery Procedures** (SOPs): Provide clear paths to fix violations
-
-Our Agent Sessions Protocol should implement all five layers to ensure consistent adherence to the worktree workflow.

 This document recontextualizes the root causes of protocol violations, emphasizing that **implementing robust passive restraints is the foundational solution** to ensure consistent adherence to the Agent Sessions Protocol.
 
+## Remediation Strategies: First-Line Defenses for Protocol Adherence
+
+To address the identified protocol violations, we must implement robust, non-agent-behavior-dependent remediation strategies as first-line defenses. These mechanisms act as "passive restraints" or "poka-yoke" (error-proofing) to prevent errors before they occur or make them immediately obvious.
+
+### 1. Git Hooks (Pre-commit/Pre-push)
+
+Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events like commit or push. They are ideal for enforcing repository-level policies without relying on agent discretion.
+
+*   **Pre-commit Hook**:
+    *   **Purpose**: Prevent commits to non-session branches or from outside the worktree.
+    *   **Implementation**: A script that checks `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` against the expected session branch and `pwd` against the worktree path. If conditions are not met, the commit is aborted.
+    *   **Example**:
+        ```bash
+        #!/bin/bash
+        SESSION_BRANCH_PREFIX="session/"
+        CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
+        if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "$SESSION_BRANCH_PREFIX"* ]]; then
+            echo "ERROR: Cannot commit to non-session branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
+            exit 1
+        fi
+        # Further checks for worktree path can be added here
+        ```
+
+*   **Pre-push Hook**:
+    *   **Purpose**: Ensure all changes are pushed to the correct session branch.
+    *   **Implementation**: A script that verifies the remote branch matches the local session branch.
+
+### 2. Enhanced Shell Environment (Non-Agent Dependent)
+
+The shell environment itself can provide continuous, passive feedback and enforce rules.
+
+*   **Prompt Modification**:
+    *   **Purpose**: Visually remind the agent of the current branch and worktree status.
+    *   **Implementation**: Modify the `PS1` (prompt string 1) environment variable to display the current Git branch and an indicator if the current directory is within a worktree. This information is always visible, reducing "PWD Anchoring Loss."
+    *   **Example**:
+        ```bash
+        # In .session-env or similar sourced file
+        export PS1='[\u@\h \W $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)]$(pwd | grep -q ".worktrees" && echo " [WORKTREE]" || echo " [MAIN]")\$ '
+        ```
+    *   **Agent Awareness**: Agents must be explicitly instructed to parse and utilize this prompt information as a primary source of truth for their current operational context. They should be aware that if the `[WORKTREE]` indicator is missing or the branch name is incorrect, they need to source their session environment or change directories.
+
+*   **Environment Variable Enforcement**:
+    *   **Purpose**: Define critical session parameters that agents must adhere to.
+    *   **Implementation**: Set `SESSION_SLUG`, `SESSION_BRANCH`, and `SESSION_DIR` variables upon sourcing the session environment. These variables can then be referenced by other scripts or agent logic.
+    *   **Agent Awareness**: Agents should be trained to always check for the presence and correctness of these environment variables before performing session-critical actions. If not set, the agent should be instructed to source the session environment.
+
+### 3. File System Guardrails
+
+*   **Directory Structure Enforcement**:
+    *   **Purpose**: Prevent file creation in incorrect locations.
+    *   **Implementation**: While not a "hook," the agent's internal logic can be guided by rules that explicitly state where files *must* be created (e.g., `_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/` or `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`).
+    *   **Passive Restraint Integration**: A `.roo/rules` file can contain regex patterns or explicit paths for allowed file creation locations.

 ## Current Protocol Documentation Analysis

     -   Agent inadvertently made changes to the `main` branch.
     -   **Passive Restraint Solution**: Rules can explicitly prohibit operations on non-session branches, acting as a strong preventive measure.
 
-## Documentation Gaps Identified (Addressed by Passive Restraints)
-
-The identified documentation "gaps" are not necessarily a lack of *information*, but a lack of *enforcement*. Passive restraints directly address these by embedding the "needed" validations and checks into the agent's operational environment.
-
-1.  **Missing: Explicit Worktree Validation**:
-    -   **Needed**: "Verify you're in worktree: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Not in worktree directory'"`
-    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: This check can be a rule that automatically runs before file operations.
-
-2.  **Missing: File Location Validation**:
-    -   **Needed**: "Check file location: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Creating file outside worktree'"`
-    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: A rule can prevent file creation outside the worktree.
-
-3.  **Missing: Protocol Compliance Checks**:
-    -   **Needed**: Regular protocol compliance validation steps.
-    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: Rules define these as automatic, continuous checks.
-
-4.  **Missing: Error Recovery Procedures**:
-    -   **Needed**: "If you realize you're working outside worktree: [recovery steps]"
-    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: Rules can include explicit recovery instructions for common violations.
-
-5.  **Missing: Active Session Branch Validation**:
-    -   **Needed**: "Verify current branch: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | grep -q 'session/$SESSION_SLUG' || echo 'ERROR: Not in session branch'"`
-    -   **Passive Restraint Integration**: A rule can enforce this check before any Git commit/push.
-
-## Strategies for Helping the Agent Adhere to the Session Branch (Re-framed by Passive Restraints)
-
-The previously identified strategies are all mechanisms that can be *implemented through* or *reinforced by* passive restraints.
-
-1.  **Pre-command Hooks/Aliases**: Can be defined and enforced by passive restraint rules.
-2.  **Environment Variable Enforcement**: Passive restraints can ensure correct environment variable setup and usage.
-3.  **Enhanced Shell Prompt**: Passive restraints can guide the agent to configure a prompt that provides critical context.
-4.  **Automated Context Switching**: Passive restraints can define the conditions and actions for automatic context switching.
-5.  **Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks**: Passive restraints can specify and even generate these Git hooks.
-6.  **Clearer Documentation and Training**: Passive restraints serve as a living, executable form of this documentation.

+## Conclusion: Prioritizing First-Line Defenses
 
-The core Agent Sessions Protocol is sound, but the failure was in **execution and decision-making** due to a lack of **continuous, automatic enforcement**. The solution is not merely more documentation or reactive validation, but the proactive implementation of **passive restraint mechanisms**.

Subject: [PATCH 07/18] [2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol] feat:
 transition to hub-spoke architecture with shallow clones

- Replace Git worktrees with hub-and-spoke architecture using shallow clones
- Update all session documentation to reflect new architecture
- Complete investigation of worktree protocol violations and root causes
- Design comprehensive passive restraint mechanisms for new architecture
- Update agent awareness guidelines for session clones
- Create detailed hub-spoke architecture documentation and transition summary

Key changes:
- SESSION.md: Updated context and implementation plan for hub-spoke
- analysis-findings.md: Root cause analysis and architectural decision
- agent-awareness-guidelines.md: Updated for session clones with [SESSION] indicators
- SESSIONS-README.md: Updated quick start and directory structure
- SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md: Replaced worktrees section with hub-spoke setup
- Added comprehensive design documents for all passive restraint mechanisms
- Created transition summary documenting architectural decision and benefits

This addresses the fundamental issue that worktrees introduce conceptual complexity
leading to protocol violations, replacing it with a simpler, more reliable standard
Git workflow using independent shallow clones.

 - The agent's understanding of when and how to use worktrees
 - Missing validation steps to ensure proper worktree usage
 - Inadequate safeguards against working directory confusion
+- **The worktree approach itself being too complex for reliable agent execution**
+
+## Investigation Findings
+
+### Root Cause Analysis
+Through comprehensive investigation, the primary issues were identified as:
+
+1. **Agent Decision-Making Failure**: The agent consistently failed to follow explicit worktree instructions
+2. **Missing Passive Restraints**: Lack of automatic enforcement mechanisms
+3. **Worktree Conceptual Complexity**: Worktrees introduce cognitive overhead that leads to errors
+4. **Shared State Confusion**: Worktrees share Git state, making boundaries unclear
+
+### Critical Discovery: Hub-Spoke Superiority
+Investigation of alternative approaches revealed that a **hub-and-spoke architecture with shallow clones** is superior for agent sessions:
+
+- **Simpler Mental Model**: Standard Git workflow, no special concepts
+- **Complete Isolation**: Each session is truly independent
+- **Ephemeral by Nature**: Sessions are temporary, shallow clones are temporary
+- **Network Independence**: Sessions work offline, only main repo connects to cloud
+- **Robust and Reliable**: No fragile dependencies, works across filesystems
+
+## Architecture Decision
+
+### Decision: Replace Worktrees with Hub-Spoke Shallow Clones
+
+**Rationale**:
+1. **Aligns with Ephemeral Nature**: Sessions are temporary by definition
+2. **Simplifies Agent Understanding**: Standard Git workflow, no worktree concepts
+3. **Maximizes Isolation**: Each session is completely independent
+4. **Minimizes Risk**: Clear boundaries, hard to violate protocol
+5. **Optimizes for Local Work**: Fast creation, offline capability
+6. **Centralizes Cloud Access**: Only main repo needs credentials/config
+
+### New Architecture
+```
+Cloud (GitHub)
+    ↓
+Main Repo (on-disk, full history)
+    ↓
+Session Clones (shallow, ephemeral)
+```

+# Agent Awareness Guidelines for Hub-Spoke Architecture
+
+## Overview
+
+This document provides explicit instructions for AI agents on how to check the `PS1` prompt, environment variables, and other contextual indicators to ensure they are operating within the correct session context in the **hub-and-spoke architecture with shallow clones**. These guidelines serve as the "agent behavior" component that complements the passive restraint mechanisms.
+
+## Core Principle
+
+**Before performing any session-critical operation, agents MUST verify their operational context using available environmental indicators.**
+
+## Hub-Spoke Architecture Context
+
+In the hub-and-spoke model:
+- **Main Repo**: Serves as the hub with full Git history
+- **Session Clones**: Independent shallow clones in `.sessions/{session-slug}/` directories
+- **Standard Git Workflow**: No special worktree concepts, just regular Git operations
+- **Clear Boundaries**: Each session is a completely separate repository clone
+
+## Environmental Indicators Hierarchy
+
+Agents should check indicators in this order:
+
+1. **PS1 Prompt** (Most immediately visible)
+2. **Environment Variables** (Most reliable)
+3. **Current Working Directory** (Foundational)
+4. **Git Branch** (Repository state)
+
+## 1. PS1 Prompt Interpretation for Session Clones
+
+### What to Look For
+
+The enhanced PS1 prompt provides real-time visual feedback for session clones:
+
+```
+[user@host dir branch-name] [STATUS]$
+```
+
+### Prompt Components
+
+| Component | Example | Meaning |
+|-----------|---------|---------|
+| `branch-name` | `session/2025-10-16-test` | Current Git branch |
+| `[SESSION]` | Green indicator | In session clone directory |
+| `[MAIN]` | Yellow/Red indicator | NOT in session clone directory |
+| Color | Green/Yellow/Red | Overall context status |
+
+### Color Coding for Hub-Spoke
+
+- **Green**: ✅ All good - in session clone on session branch
+- **Yellow**: ⚠️ Warning - in session clone but wrong branch
+- **Red**: ❌ Danger - not in session clone directory
+
+### Agent Actions Based on Prompt
+
+#### If Prompt Shows `[MAIN]` (Red)
+```
+Action Required: STOP and fix environment
+Steps:
+1. Identify the session slug from the task context
+2. cd .sessions/{session-slug}
+3. source .session-env
+4. Verify prompt now shows [SESSION] in green
+```
+
+#### If Prompt Shows Wrong Branch (Yellow)
+```
+Action Required: Switch to correct branch
+Steps:
+1. Verify the expected session branch name
+2. git checkout session/{session-slug}
+3. Verify prompt now shows correct branch in green
+```
+
+#### If Prompt Shows `[SESSION]` + Correct Branch (Green)
+```
+Status: SAFE to proceed with session operations
+```
+
+### Prompt Verification Command
+
+Agents should mentally execute this check:
+
+```bash
+# Pseudo-code for agent reasoning
+if prompt_shows("[MAIN]") or not prompt_shows("[WORKTREE]"):
+    stop_and_fix_environment()
+elif prompt_branch != expected_session_branch:
+    switch_to_correct_branch()
+else:
+    safe_to_proceed()
+```
+
+## 2. Environment Variable Checks
+
+### Required Variables
+
+Before any session operation, verify these variables are set:
+
+```bash
+echo $SESSION_SLUG
+echo $SESSION_BRANCH  
+echo $SESSION_DIR
+echo $SESSION_ACTIVE
+```
+
+### Verification Procedure
+
+```bash
+# Agent should conceptually execute:
+if [ -z "$SESSION_SLUG" ]; then
+    echo "ERROR: Session environment not sourced"
+    echo "Run: source _AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/.session-env"
+    exit 1
+fi
+```
+
+### Agent Decision Tree
+
+```
+Is SESSION_SLUG set?
+├─ NO → Source session environment
+│       └─ source .session-env
+│       └─ Verify variables now set
+└─ YES → Validate values
+         ├─ Does SESSION_BRANCH match expected?
+         │  ├─ NO → Fix branch discrepancy
+         │  └─ YES → Continue
+         └─ Does SESSION_DIR match pwd?
+            ├─ NO → Change to SESSION_DIR
+            └─ YES → Safe to proceed
+```
+
+## 3. Working Directory Awareness
+
+### Critical Rule
+
+**File operations MUST only occur within the session worktree directory.**
+
+### Directory Verification
+
+Before creating or modifying files:
+
+```bash
+# Agent reasoning:
+current_dir=$(pwd)
+if [[ "$current_dir" != *".worktrees/"* ]]; then
+    echo "ERROR: Not in worktree directory"
+    echo "Current: $current_dir"
+    echo "Expected: .worktrees/{session-slug}/"
+    # STOP - do not proceed with file operation
+fi
+```
+
+### Safe File Operations
+
+```bash
+# Before writing files, verify:
+1. Check: pwd contains ".worktrees/"
+2. Check: pwd matches $SESSION_DIR
+3. Only then: Proceed with file operation
+```
+
+### Example Agent Workflow
+
+```
+User: "Create a new file called analysis.md"
+
+Agent Internal Checklist:
+1. ✓ Check PS1 prompt → Shows [WORKTREE] in green
+2. ✓ Check SESSION_SLUG → Set to "2025-10-16-test"
+3. ✓ Check pwd → In .worktrees/2025-10-16-test
+4. ✓ Safe to create file
+
+Action: Create analysis.md in current directory
+```
+
+## 4. Git Branch Validation
+
+### Before ANY Git Operation
+
+```bash
+# Agent must verify:
+current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
+expected_branch="session/${SESSION_SLUG}"
+
+if [[ "$current_branch" != "$expected_branch" ]]; then
+    echo "ERROR: On wrong branch"
+    echo "Current: $current_branch"
+    echo "Expected: $expected_branch"
+    # Offer to switch or abort
+fi
+```
+
+### Git Operation Safety Matrix
+
+| Operation | Required Check | Action if Check Fails |
+|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
+| `git add` | In worktree | Stop, cd to worktree |
+| `git commit` | On session branch | Stop, checkout branch |
+| `git push` | On session branch | Stop, verify branch |
+| `git checkout` | N/A | Allowed (for fixing) |
+
+## 5. Session Environment Activation
+
+### When to Source
+
+Source the session environment in these scenarios:
+
+1. **At session start**: Always source before beginning work
+2. **After directory change**: If you cd out of worktree and back
+3. **If variables are unset**: If $SESSION_SLUG is empty
+4. **If prompt shows [MAIN]**: Indicates environment not active
+
+### Sourcing Procedure
+
+```bash
+# Agent command sequence:
+cd .worktrees/{session-slug}
+source ../../_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/.session-env
+
+# Verify activation:
+- Check SESSION_SLUG is set
+- Check prompt shows [WORKTREE]
+- Check pwd is in worktree
+```
+
+### Re-sourcing Safety
+
+The session environment is designed to prevent harmful double-sourcing:
+
+```bash
+# Safe to source multiple times
+source .session-env  # First time
+source .session-env  # Second time - will detect and skip
+```
+
+## 6. Operational Safety Checklist
+
+### Before File Creation
+
+- [ ] PS1 prompt shows `[WORKTREE]` in green
+- [ ] `$SESSION_DIR` is set
+- [ ] `pwd` is within `.worktrees/`
+- [ ] `pwd` matches `$SESSION_DIR`
+
+### Before Git Commit
+
+- [ ] PS1 prompt shows correct branch
+- [ ] `$SESSION_BRANCH` is set
+- [ ] Current branch matches `$SESSION_BRANCH`
+- [ ] In worktree directory
+
+### Before Git Push
+
+- [ ] All "Before Git Commit" checks pass
+- [ ] Remote branch is session branch
+- [ ] No commits to main/dev
+
+### At Session Start
+
+- [ ] Session claimed (in `active/` directory)
+- [ ] Worktree exists
+- [ ] Changed to worktree directory
+- [ ] Sourced session environment
+- [ ] All variables set correctly
+
+## 7. Error Recovery Procedures
+
+### Error: Not in Worktree
+
+```
+Symptom: Prompt shows [MAIN]
+Cause: Working in main repository directory
+
+Recovery:
+1. Identify session slug from context
+2. cd .worktrees/{session-slug}
+3. source ../../_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/.session-env
+4. Verify prompt now green with [WORKTREE]
+```
+
+### Error: Wrong Branch
+
+```
+Symptom: Prompt shows different branch than expected
+Cause: On wrong Git branch
+
+Recovery:
+1. Check expected branch: echo $SESSION_BRANCH
+2. Switch: git checkout $SESSION_BRANCH
+3. Verify prompt now shows correct branch
+```
+
+### Error: Environment Not Sourced
+
+```
+Symptom: $SESSION_SLUG is empty
+Cause: Session environment not activated
+
+Recovery:
+1. Ensure in worktree: cd .worktrees/{session-slug}
+2. Source environment: source ../../_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/.session-env
+3. Verify: echo $SESSION_SLUG
+```
+
+### Error: Files in Wrong Location
+
+```
+Symptom: Created files outside worktree
+Cause: Worked in wrong directory
+
+Recovery:
+1. Identify misplaced files
+2. Move to correct location:
+   mv /wrong/location/file .worktrees/{session-slug}/
+3. Update Git tracking if needed
+```
+
+## 8. Agent Self-Validation Commands
+
+Agents should periodically validate their context:
+
+### Quick Status Check
+
+```bash
+# Mental execution before operations:
+echo "Branch: $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
+echo "Dir: $(pwd)"
+echo "Session: $SESSION_SLUG"
+```
+
+### Full Validation
+
+```bash
+# Run the built-in validation:
+validate_session_vars && validate_session_values
+# Or call the session info function:
+session_info
+```
+
+## 9. Integration with .roo/rules
+
+These agent awareness guidelines complement the `.roo/rules` passive restraints:
+
+**`.roo/rules` provides**: Persistent, always-available protocol rules
+
+**Agent Awareness provides**: Behavioral instructions for interpreting and acting on those rules
+
+### Synergy
+
+```
+.roo/rules says: "MUST work in worktree"
+Agent Awareness says: "HOW to verify you're in worktree (check prompt/pwd)"
+
+.roo/rules says: "MUST be on session branch"
+Agent Awareness says: "HOW to verify branch (check $SESSION_BRANCH)"
+```
+
+## 10. Training Scenarios
+
+### Scenario 1: Starting a Session
+
+```
+Context: User says "work on session 2025-10-16-test"
+
+Agent Actions:
+1. Check if session exists in active/
+2. cd .worktrees/2025-10-16-test
+3. source ../../_AGENTS/sessions/active/2025-10-16-test/.session-env
+4. Verify prompt shows [WORKTREE] and correct branch
+5. Ready to proceed
+
+Checkpoints:
+✓ Directory changed
+✓ Environment sourced
+✓ Prompt verified
+✓ Variables set
+```
+
+### Scenario 2: Creating a File
+
+```
+Context: User says "create analysis.md with findings"
+
+Agent Pre-Flight:
+1. Check prompt → Green [WORKTREE]
+2. Check pwd → In .worktrees/2025-10-16-test
+3. Check SESSION_DIR → Matches pwd
+4. Safe to create file
+
+Agent Action:
+Create analysis.md in current directory
+
+Post-Action:
+File created in correct location
+```
+
+### Scenario 3: Committing Changes
+
+```
+Context: User says "commit the changes"
+
+Agent Pre-Flight:
+1. Check prompt → Shows session/2025-10-16-test
+2. Check $SESSION_BRANCH → Matches current branch
+3. Check pwd → In worktree
+4. Safe to commit
+
+Agent Action:
+git add .
+git commit -m "message"
+
+Post-Action:
+Commit on correct branch, in worktree
+```
+
+## 11. Anti-Patterns to Avoid
+
+### ❌ Don't: Assume Environment is Correct
+
+```
+Bad: Just start creating files
+Good: Check prompt and variables first
+```
+
+### ❌ Don't: Ignore Prompt Colors
+
+```
+Bad: See red prompt, proceed anyway
+Good: See red prompt, stop and fix environment
+```
+
+### ❌ Don't: Work from Main Directory
+
+```
+Bad: cd to repo root and create files
+Good: Always work from within worktree
+```
+
+### ❌ Don't: Skip Environment Sourcing
+
+```
+Bad: "I'll just remember the session name"
+Good: Always source .session-env to set variables
+```
+
+### ❌ Don't: Commit to Main Branch
+
+```
+Bad: Commit to main during a session
+Good: Verify on session branch before commit
+```
+
+## 12. Success Indicators
+
+An agent is correctly following these guidelines when:
+
+- ✅ Prompt is always green when working
+- ✅ All operations occur in worktree
+- ✅ All commits are on session branch
+- ✅ Variables are always set
+- ✅ No files created in wrong locations
+- ✅ No protocol violation errors
+

+└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
+```
+
+## 14. Implementation Notes
+
+These guidelines should be:
+
+1. **Integrated into agent training**: Core knowledge for all agents
+2. **Referenced in `.roo/rules`**: Linked from passive restraints
+3. **Included in session docs**: Part of SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md
+4. **Validated in testing**: Verify agents follow guidelines
+5. **Updated as needed**: Refine based on real-world usage
+
+## Conclusion
+
+By consistently following these agent awareness guidelines, AI agents can effectively:
+
+- Verify their operational context
+- Prevent protocol violations
+- Recover from errors quickly
+- Maintain session isolation
+- Work safely within the Agent Sessions Protocol
+
+These guidelines transform passive restraints from static rules into actionable, contextual intelligence that guides agent behavior in real-time.

-# Worktree Protocol Investigation: Centering on Passive Restraint Strategy
+# Worktree Protocol Investigation: Hub-Spoke Architecture Transition
 
-## Executive Summary: The Critical Role of Passive Restraints
+## Executive Summary: From Worktrees to Hub-Spoke Architecture
 
-This investigation into worktree protocol violations during previous agent sessions reveals a fundamental gap: the absence of **passive restraint mechanisms**. While existing protocol documentation is clear, the agent's consistent failure in execution and decision-making highlights a critical need for always-on, context-aware guidance.
+This investigation into worktree protocol violations during previous agent sessions revealed fundamental issues with the worktree approach itself. While passive restraint mechanisms are valuable, the core problem is that **Git worktrees are conceptually too complex for reliable agent execution**.
 
-**Passive restraints** (e.g., `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`) are configuration files that AI agents automatically consult before taking actions. They act as persistent, project-specific guardrails, embodying "poka-yoke" (error-proofing) principles by making correct behavior easier and incorrect behavior harder. Their absence meant agents relied solely on transient system prompts or reactive validation, leading to:
+**Critical Discovery**: A **hub-and-spoke architecture with shallow clones** is superior for agent sessions because:
 
--   Working outside the designated worktree.
--   Creating files in incorrect locations.
--   Operating on the wrong Git branch.
+- **Simpler Mental Model**: Standard Git workflow, no special concepts
+- **Complete Isolation**: Each session is truly independent
+- **Ephemeral by Nature**: Sessions are temporary, shallow clones are temporary
+- **Network Independence**: Sessions work offline, only main repo connects to cloud
+- **Robust and Reliable**: No fragile dependencies, works across filesystems
 
-This document recontextualizes the root causes of protocol violations, emphasizing that **implementing robust passive restraints is the foundational solution** to ensure consistent adherence to the Agent Sessions Protocol.
+This document presents the investigation findings and the architectural decision to **transition from worktrees to a hub-spoke methodology** with shallow clones as the foundation for the Agent Sessions Protocol.
 
-## Remediation Strategies: First-Line Defenses for Protocol Adherence
+## Investigation Findings: Root Causes and Solutions
 
-To address the identified protocol violations, we must implement robust, non-agent-behavior-dependent remediation strategies as first-line defenses. These mechanisms act as "passive restraints" or "poka-yoke" (error-proofing) to prevent errors before they occur or make them immediately obvious.
+### Root Cause Analysis
+The investigation identified multiple contributing factors to worktree protocol violations:
 
-### 1. Git Hooks (Pre-commit/Pre-push)
+1. **Conceptual Complexity**: Worktrees introduce cognitive overhead that agents struggle with
+2. **Shared State Confusion**: Worktrees share Git state, making boundaries unclear
+3. **Missing Passive Restraints**: Lack of automatic enforcement mechanisms
+4. **Decision-Making Failure**: Agents consistently failed to follow explicit worktree instructions
+5. **Workflow Friction**: Non-standard Git operations that require special knowledge
 
-Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events like commit or push. They are ideal for enforcing repository-level policies without relying on agent discretion.
+### Architectural Decision: Hub-Spoke with Shallow Clones
+
+After comprehensive evaluation of alternatives (reference clones, shallow clones, full clones), the **hub-and-spoke architecture with shallow clones** emerges as the optimal solution:
+
+```
+Cloud (GitHub)
+    ↓
+Main Repo (on-disk, full history)
+    ↓
+Session Clones (shallow, ephemeral)
+```
+
+### Why Hub-Spoke Solves Core Problems
+
+1. **Eliminates Conceptual Complexity**: Standard Git repository workflow
+2. **Provides Complete Isolation**: Each session is independent
+3. **Aligns with Ephemeral Nature**: Sessions are temporary by definition
+4. **Simplifies Agent Understanding**: No special concepts to learn
+5. **Maximizes Reliability**: No fragile dependencies or shared state
+
+## Updated Remediation Strategies: Hub-Spoke Implementation
+
+The transition to hub-spoke architecture requires implementing new remediation strategies tailored for shallow clones:
+
+### 1. Git Hooks for Session Clones
+
+Git hooks are adapted for the hub-spoke architecture to enforce session isolation.
 
 *   **Pre-commit Hook**:
-    *   **Purpose**: Prevent commits to non-session branches or from outside the worktree.
-    *   **Implementation**: A script that checks `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` against the expected session branch and `pwd` against the worktree path. If conditions are not met, the commit is aborted.
+    *   **Purpose**: Prevent commits to non-session branches or from outside the session directory.
+    *   **Implementation**: A script that checks `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` against the expected session branch and `pwd` against the session directory.
     *   **Example**:

-        # In .session-env or similar sourced file
-        export PS1='[\u@\h \W $(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)]$(pwd | grep -q ".worktrees" && echo " [WORKTREE]" || echo " [MAIN]")\$ '

+# Environment Variable Enforcement Design
+
+## Overview
+
+This document defines the critical session environment variables (`SESSION_SLUG`, `SESSION_BRANCH`, `SESSION_DIR`) and their enforcement mechanisms to ensure agents operate within the correct session context.
+
+## Core Environment Variables
+
+### 1. SESSION_SLUG
+
+**Purpose**: Unique identifier for the current session
+
+**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-description`
+
+**Example**: `2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol`
+
+**Usage**:
+- Identifies which session is active
+- Used in file paths
+- Used in branch names
+- Referenced by scripts
+
+**Setting**:
+```bash
+export SESSION_SLUG="2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol"
+```
+
+### 2. SESSION_BRANCH
+
+**Purpose**: Git branch name for the current session
+
+**Format**: `session/${SESSION_SLUG}`
+
+**Example**: `session/2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol`
+
+**Usage**:
+- Validates commits are on correct branch
+- Used by Git hooks
+- Displayed in prompts
+
+**Setting**:
+```bash
+export SESSION_BRANCH="session/${SESSION_SLUG}"
+```
+
+### 3. SESSION_DIR
+
+**Purpose**: Absolute path to the session worktree directory
+
+**Format**: `/absolute/path/to/.worktrees/${SESSION_SLUG}`
+
+**Example**: `/home/user/project/.worktrees/2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol`
+
+**Usage**:
+- Validates file operations are in correct directory
+- Used for relative path calculations
+- Referenced by scripts
+
+**Setting**:
+```bash
+export SESSION_DIR="$(pwd)"  # When sourced from worktree
+# Or explicitly:
+export SESSION_DIR="/home/user/project/.worktrees/${SESSION_SLUG}"
+```
+
+## Additional Supporting Variables
+
+### 4. SESSION_ACTIVE
+
+**Purpose**: Boolean flag indicating if a session environment is active
+
+**Values**: `true` or `false` (or unset)
+
+**Usage**:
+- Quick check if session environment is sourced
+- Prevents double-sourcing
+
+**Setting**:
+```bash
+export SESSION_ACTIVE="true"
+```
+
+### 5. SESSION_START_TIME
+
+**Purpose**: Timestamp when session was activated
+
+**Format**: Unix timestamp or ISO 8601
+
+**Usage**:
+- Track session duration
+- Logging and analytics
+
+**Setting**:
+```bash
+export SESSION_START_TIME=$(date +%s)
+# Or ISO format:
+export SESSION_START_TIME=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
+```
+
+### 6. ORIGINAL_PS1
+
+**Purpose**: Preserve original prompt before modification
+
+**Usage**:
+- Restore prompt when session ends
+- Prevent nested prompt modifications
+
+**Setting**:
+```bash
+if [ -z "$ORIGINAL_PS1" ]; then
+    export ORIGINAL_PS1="$PS1"
+fi
+```
+
+## Enforcement Mechanisms
+
+### 1. Validation Functions
+
+```bash
+# Validate all required session variables are set
+validate_session_vars() {
+    local missing=()
+    
+    [ -z "$SESSION_SLUG" ] && missing+=("SESSION_SLUG")
+    [ -z "$SESSION_BRANCH" ] && missing+=("SESSION_BRANCH")
+    [ -z "$SESSION_DIR" ] && missing+=("SESSION_DIR")
+    
+    if [ ${#missing[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
+        echo "ERROR: Missing required session variables:"
+        printf '  - %s\n' "${missing[@]}"
+        return 1
+    fi
+    
+    return 0
+}
+
+# Validate session variables have correct values
+validate_session_values() {
+    local errors=0
+    
+    # Check SESSION_BRANCH matches SESSION_SLUG
+    if [[ "$SESSION_BRANCH" != "session/$SESSION_SLUG" ]]; then
+        echo "ERROR: SESSION_BRANCH mismatch"
+        echo "  Expected: session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+        echo "  Actual:   $SESSION_BRANCH"
+        errors=$((errors + 1))
+    fi
+    
+    # Check SESSION_DIR exists and is a directory
+    if [ ! -d "$SESSION_DIR" ]; then
+        echo "ERROR: SESSION_DIR does not exist or is not a directory"
+        echo "  Path: $SESSION_DIR"
+        errors=$((errors + 1))
+    fi
+    
+    # Check SESSION_DIR is in .worktrees
+    if [[ "$SESSION_DIR" != *".worktrees"* ]]; then
+        echo "ERROR: SESSION_DIR is not in .worktrees directory"
+        echo "  Path: $SESSION_DIR"
+        errors=$((errors + 1))
+    fi
+    
+    # Check current directory matches SESSION_DIR
+    if [[ "$(pwd)" != "$SESSION_DIR"* ]]; then
+        echo "WARNING: Current directory is not within SESSION_DIR"
+        echo "  Current: $(pwd)"
+        echo "  Expected: $SESSION_DIR"
+    fi
+    
+    return $errors
+}
+```
+
+### 2. Automatic Validation on Sourcing
+
+```bash
+# In .session-env, add automatic validation
+if ! validate_session_vars; then
+    echo "ERROR: Session environment validation failed"
+    return 1
+fi
+
+if ! validate_session_values; then
+    echo "WARNING: Session environment has incorrect values"
+fi
+```
+
+### 3. Pre-command Validation (Optional)
+
+For stricter enforcement, validate before critical operations:
+
+```bash
+# Wrapper function for git commands
+git() {
+    # Validate session environment before git operations
+    if [ "$1" = "commit" ] || [ "$1" = "push" ]; then
+        if ! validate_session_vars &>/dev/null; then
+            echo "ERROR: Session environment not properly configured"
+            echo "Run: source .session-env"
+            return 1
+        fi
+    fi
+    
+    command git "$@"
+}
+```
+
+### 4. Directory Change Monitoring
+
+Monitor directory changes to warn if leaving session directory:
+
+```bash
+# Add to .session-env
+cd() {
+    builtin cd "$@"
+    
+    # Warn if changing out of session directory
+    if [[ "$(pwd)" != "$SESSION_DIR"* ]] && [ -n "$SESSION_DIR" ]; then
+        echo "⚠️  Warning: You have left the session directory"
+        echo "   Session: $SESSION_DIR"
+        echo "   Current: $(pwd)"
+    fi
+}
+```
+
+## Complete .session-env Template
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash

+## Integration with claim-session Script
+
+The `claim-session` script should generate the `.session-env` file with proper values:
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# claim-session script snippet
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+WORKTREE_DIR=".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Create .session-env file
+cat > "_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG/.session-env" <<EOF
+#!/bin/bash
+# Generated session environment for $SESSION_SLUG
+# Do not edit manually - regenerate with claim-session
+
+export SESSION_SLUG="$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_BRANCH="session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_DIR="\$(cd \$(dirname "\${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/../../../.worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG && pwd)"
+export SESSION_ACTIVE="true"
+export SESSION_START_TIME=\$(date +%s)
+
+# ... (include all functions and prompt setup)
+EOF
+
+chmod +x "_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG/.session-env"
+```
+
+## Testing Strategy
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# test-env-vars.sh
+
+echo "=== Testing Environment Variable Enforcement ==="
+
+# Test 1: Source environment
+source .session-env
+if [ "$SESSION_ACTIVE" = "true" ]; then

+
+echo "=== Tests complete ==="
+```
+
+## Security Considerations
+
+1. **Path Injection**: SESSION_DIR should be validated to prevent path traversal
+2. **Variable Tampering**: Variables should not be modifiable after initial setup
+3. **Isolation**: Each session should have independent variable scope
+
+## Future Enhancements
+
+1. **Session Locking**: Prevent multiple sessions with same slug
+2. **Session History**: Track previous session activations
+3. **Resource Limits**: Enforce limits on session duration or file operations
+4. **Audit Logging**: Log all session variable changes

+# File System Guardrails Design
+
+## Overview
+
+This document defines strategies and rules for controlling where files can be created during active sessions, ensuring all session-related files remain within the designated worktree directory.
+
+## Objective
+
+Prevent file creation outside the session worktree by:
+1. Defining allowed file creation paths
+2. Implementing validation mechanisms
+3. Providing clear error messages
+4. Integrating with passive restraint systems
+
+## Allowed File Creation Paths
+
+### Primary Rule
+
+**All session work files MUST be created within the worktree directory.**
+
+```
+Allowed:    .worktrees/{session-slug}/**/*
+Forbidden:  Everything else
+```
+
+### Path Patterns
+
+#### Allowed Patterns (Regex)
+
+```regex
+# Any file within the worktree for this session
+^\.worktrees/[^/]+/.*$
+
+# More specific - must match session slug
+^\.worktrees/${SESSION_SLUG}/.*$
+```
+
+#### Forbidden Patterns (Regex)
+
+```regex
+# Repository root
+^(?!\.worktrees/).*$
+
+# Other worktrees
+^\.worktrees/(?!${SESSION_SLUG}/).*$
+
+# Parent directories
+^\.\./.*$
+
+# Absolute paths outside workspace
+^/(?!.*\.worktrees/${SESSION_SLUG}).*$
+```
+
+### Exception Paths
+
+Some operations may legitimately need to access files outside the worktree:
+
+```
+Read-only Access Allowed:
+- _AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/  (session metadata)
+- _AGENTS/sessions/_templates/              (templates)
+- .git/                                     (Git metadata, read-only)
+- README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md                (documentation, read-only)
+
+Write Access Forbidden Everywhere Except:
+- .worktrees/{session-slug}/**/*
+```
+
+## Validation Mechanisms
+
+### 1. Path Validation Function
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# validate_file_path.sh
+# Validates that a file path is within the session worktree
+
+validate_file_path() {
+    local file_path="$1"
+    local operation="${2:-write}"  # write, read, or execute
+    
+    # Normalize path to absolute
+    local abs_path=$(realpath -m "$file_path" 2>/dev/null || echo "$file_path")
+    
+    # Get session worktree path
+    local worktree_path="${SESSION_DIR:-}"
+    
+    if [ -z "$worktree_path" ]; then
+        echo "ERROR: SESSION_DIR not set. Source session environment first."
+        return 1
+    fi
+    
+    # Normalize worktree path
+    worktree_path=$(realpath -m "$worktree_path")
+    
+    # Check if file is within worktree
+    case "$abs_path" in
+        "$worktree_path"/*)
+            # File is within worktree - allowed
+            return 0
+            ;;
+        *)
+            # File is outside worktree
+            if [ "$operation" = "read" ]; then
+                # Read operations may be allowed for certain paths
+                case "$abs_path" in
+                    *"/_AGENTS/sessions/active/"*)
+                        echo "INFO: Read access to session metadata allowed"
+                        return 0
+                        ;;
+                    *"/_AGENTS/sessions/_templates/"*)
+                        echo "INFO: Read access to templates allowed"
+                        return 0
+                        ;;
+                    *)
+                        echo "WARNING: Reading file outside worktree: $abs_path"
+                        return 2  # Warning, not error
+                        ;;
+                esac
+            else
+                # Write/execute operations outside worktree are forbidden
+                echo "ERROR: Cannot $operation file outside worktree"
+                echo "  File:     $abs_path"
+                echo "  Worktree: $worktree_path"
+                return 1
+            fi
+            ;;
+    esac
+}
+
+# Wrapper for common file operations
+safe_touch() {
+    validate_file_path "$1" "write" || return 1
+    touch "$1"
+}
+
+safe_mkdir() {
+    validate_file_path "$1" "write" || return 1
+    mkdir -p "$1"
+}
+
+safe_write() {
+    validate_file_path "$1" "write" || return 1
+    cat > "$1"
+}
+```
+
+### 2. Integration with Shell Functions
+
+Override common file creation commands:
+
+```bash
+# Add to .session-env
+
+# Override touch
+touch() {
+    local file="$1"
+    if ! validate_file_path "$file" "write"; then
+        echo "Blocked: touch $file"
+        return 1
+    fi
+    command touch "$@"
+}
+
+# Override mkdir
+mkdir() {
+    local dir="$1"
+    if ! validate_file_path "$dir" "write"; then
+        echo "Blocked: mkdir $dir"
+        return 1
+    fi
+    command mkdir "$@"
+}
+
+# Override file redirection helper
+safe_redirect() {
+    local file="$1"
+    if ! validate_file_path "$file" "write"; then
+        echo "Blocked: redirect to $file"
+        return 1
+    fi
+    cat > "$file"
+}
+```
+
+### 3. .roo/rules Integration
+
+Define file system rules in `.roo/rules`:
+
+```markdown
+# File System Guardrails for Agent Sessions
+
+## CRITICAL: Session File Isolation
+
+When an active session exists in `_AGENTS/sessions/active/`:
+- ALL file write operations MUST occur within `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`
+- NO files may be created in the repository root
+- NO files may be created in other worktrees
+
+## File Path Validation
+
+Before creating or modifying any file:
+1. Verify `pwd` is within `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`
+2. Verify target file path is within current worktree
+3. If validation fails, STOP and correct directory
+
+## Allowed File Operations
+
+### Write Operations (Allowed)
+- `.worktrees/{session-slug}/**/*` - All files within session worktree
+
+### Read Operations (Allowed)
+- `.worktrees/{session-slug}/**/*` - Session worktree files
+- `_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/**/*` - Session metadata (read-only)
+- `_AGENTS/sessions/_templates/**/*` - Templates (read-only)
+- Repository documentation (README.md, etc.) - Read-only
+
+### Forbidden Operations
+- ❌ Creating files in repository root
+- ❌ Creating files in other worktrees
+- ❌ Modifying files outside worktree (except via Git)
+- ❌ Creating files in `_AGENTS/sessions/` directory structure
+
+## Validation Commands
+
+Check current working directory:
+```bash
+pwd | grep -q "\.worktrees/${SESSION_SLUG}" || echo "ERROR: Not in worktree"
+```
+
+Check file path before creation:
+```bash
+realpath -m "$filepath" | grep -q "\.worktrees/${SESSION_SLUG}" || echo "ERROR: File outside worktree"
+```
+```
+
+## Error Messages
+
+### Clear, Actionable Error Messages
+
+When a file system guardrail is triggered:
+
+```bash
+echo "╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗"
+echo "║  FILE SYSTEM GUARDRAIL VIOLATION                           ║"
+echo "╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝"
+echo ""
+echo "❌ ERROR: Attempted to create file outside worktree"
+echo ""
+echo "File:     $attempted_path"
+echo "Worktree: $SESSION_DIR"
+echo ""
+echo "Required Actions:"
+echo "  1. Ensure you are in the worktree directory:"
+echo "     cd .worktrees/${SESSION_SLUG}"
+echo ""
+echo "  2. Verify session environment is active:"
+echo "     echo \$SESSION_DIR"
+echo ""
+echo "  3. Create files only within the worktree"
+echo ""
+echo "For help, run: session_info"
+```
+
+## Implementation Strategies
+
+### Strategy 1: Preventive (Recommended)
+
+Prevent file creation outside worktree using shell function overrides:
+
+**Pros:**
+- Catches errors before they happen
+- No cleanup needed
+- Clear immediate feedback
+
+**Cons:**
+- May be circumvented if function is not used
+- Requires sourcing session environment
+
+**Implementation:** Included in `.session-env` as function overrides
+
+### Strategy 2: Detective
+
+Monitor file creation and alert when violations occur:
+
+**Pros:**
+- Doesn't interfere with normal operations
+- Can catch any creation method
+
+**Cons:**
+- Violations may occur before detection
+- Requires cleanup after the fact
+
+**Implementation:** Git pre-commit hook checks file locations
+
+### Strategy 3: Corrective
+
+Automatically move misplaced files to worktree:
+
+**Pros:**
+- Transparent to user
+- Files always end up in correct place
+
+**Cons:**
+- May be confusing
+- Could mask underlying issues
+
+**Implementation:** Post-creation hook or cleanup script
+
+### Recommended Approach: Layered Defense
+
+Use all three strategies:
+
+1. **Preventive** (Primary): Shell function overrides in `.session-env`
+2. **Detective** (Secondary): Pre-commit hooks validate file locations
+3. **Corrective** (Fallback): Manual cleanup tools for edge cases
+
+## File Location Audit
+
+### Audit Script
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# audit-file-locations.sh
+# Audits files created during session to ensure proper location
+
+SESSION_SLUG="${1:-$SESSION_SLUG}"
+WORKTREE_DIR=".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+if [ -z "$SESSION_SLUG" ]; then
+    echo "ERROR: SESSION_SLUG not provided"
+    exit 1
+fi
+
+echo "=== File Location Audit for $SESSION_SLUG ==="
+echo ""
+
+# Get session branch
+SESSION_BRANCH="session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Get list of files added in session
+FILES=$(git diff --name-only "$SESSION_BRANCH" $(git merge-base main "$SESSION_BRANCH"))
+
+# Check each file
+VIOLATIONS=()
+CORRECT=()
+
+while IFS= read -r file; do
+    if [[ "$file" == "$WORKTREE_DIR/"* ]]; then
+        CORRECT+=("$file")
+    else
+        VIOLATIONS+=("$file")
+    fi
+done <<< "$FILES"
+
+# Report results
+if [ ${#VIOLATIONS[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
+    echo "✅ All files in correct location"
+    echo "   Total files: ${#CORRECT[@]}"
+else
+    echo "❌ File location violations found!"
+    echo ""
+    echo "Files in wrong location:"
+    printf '  - %s\n' "${VIOLATIONS[@]}"
+    echo ""
+    echo "Correct files: ${#CORRECT[@]}"
+    echo "Violations:    ${#VIOLATIONS[@]}"
+    echo ""
+    echo "Run cleanup script to fix: cleanup-misplaced-files.sh"
+fi
+```
+
+### Cleanup Script
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# cleanup-misplaced-files.sh
+# Moves misplaced files to correct worktree location
+
+SESSION_SLUG="${1:-$SESSION_SLUG}"
+WORKTREE_DIR=".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "=== Cleaning Up Misplaced Files ==="
+echo ""
+
+# Get misplaced files
+FILES=$(git diff --name-only "session/$SESSION_SLUG" $(git merge-base main "session/$SESSION_SLUG") | grep -v "^$WORKTREE_DIR/")
+
+if [ -z "$FILES" ]; then
+    echo "✅ No misplaced files found"
+    exit 0
+fi
+
+echo "Moving files to worktree:"
+while IFS= read -r file; do
+    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
+        # Determine target path
+        target="$WORKTREE_DIR/$file"
+        
+        # Create directory if needed
+        mkdir -p "$(dirname "$target")"
+        
+        # Move file
+        echo "  $file -> $target"
+        git mv "$file" "$target"
+    fi
+done <<< "$FILES"
+
+echo ""
+echo "✅ Cleanup complete"
+echo "Files moved to: $WORKTREE_DIR"
+echo ""
+echo "Commit these changes:"
+echo "  git commit -m 'fix: Move files to correct worktree location'"
+```
+
+## Pre-commit Hook Integration
+
+Add file location check to pre-commit hook:
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# Part of pre-commit hook
+
+# Check if committing files outside worktree
+if [ -n "$SESSION_SLUG" ]; then

+    
+    # Get staged files
+    STAGED=$(git diff --cached --name-only)
+    
+    # Check each staged file
+    OUTSIDE_WORKTREE=()
+    while IFS= read -r file; do
+        if [[ "$file" != "$WORKTREE_DIR/"* ]]; then
+            OUTSIDE_WORKTREE+=("$file")
+        fi
+    done <<< "$STAGED"
+    
+    # Block commit if files outside worktree
+    if [ ${#OUTSIDE_WORKTREE[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
+        echo "ERROR: Cannot commit files outside worktree"

+# Cleanup
+cd ../..
+rm -rf ".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "=== Tests complete ==="
+```
+
+## Documentation Integration
+
+### Update SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md
+
+Add section on file system guardrails:
+
+```markdown
+## File System Guardrails
+
+When working in a session, all file operations must occur within the session worktree.
+
+### Allowed Operations
+
+✅ Create files in `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`
+✅ Read session metadata from `_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/`
+✅ Read templates from `_AGENTS/sessions/_templates/`
+
+### Forbidden Operations
+
+❌ Create files in repository root
+❌ Create files in other worktrees
+❌ Modify files outside worktree
+
+### Validation
+
+Your session environment includes automatic validation:
+- File creation commands check path before executing
+- Clear error messages if path is invalid
+- Pre-commit hooks prevent committing misplaced files
+```
+
+## Future Enhancements
+
+1. **Symbolic Link Handling**: Prevent symlinks from bypassing guardrails
+2. **Temporary File Management**: Handle `/tmp` files appropriately
+3. **Binary File Restrictions**: Additional checks for binary files
+4. **Size Limits**: Enforce maximum file sizes
+5. **File Type Restrictions**: Block certain file types if needed
+
+## Conclusion
+
+File system guardrails provide multiple layers of protection:
+
+1. **Preventive**: Function overrides stop violations before they occur
+2. **Detective**: Audit scripts identify violations
+3. **Corrective**: Cleanup tools fix violations
+
+Combined with Git hooks and agent awareness, these guardrails ensure session isolation and prevent cross-session interference.

+# Git Hooks Design for Agent Sessions Protocol
+
+## Overview
+
+This document defines the design for Git hooks that enforce session branch adherence and worktree usage, along with a safe installation method that integrates with existing hooks.
+
+## Hook 1: Pre-commit Hook
+
+### Purpose
+Prevent commits to non-session branches and ensure commits only occur from within worktrees.
+
+### Implementation
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# Pre-commit hook for Agent Sessions Protocol
+# This hook enforces session branch and worktree requirements
+
+# Check if we're on a session branch
+CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
+SESSION_BRANCH_PREFIX="session/"
+
+if [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "$SESSION_BRANCH_PREFIX"* ]]; then
+    echo "ERROR: Cannot commit to non-session branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
+    echo "You must be on a session branch (starting with 'session/')"
+    echo "Current branch: $CURRENT_BRANCH"
+    exit 1
+fi
+
+# Check if we're in a worktree
+CURRENT_DIR=$(pwd)
+if [[ ! "$CURRENT_DIR" =~ \.worktrees/ ]]; then
+    echo "ERROR: Not committing from within a worktree directory"
+    echo "Current directory: $CURRENT_DIR"
+    echo "Expected to be in: .worktrees/<session-slug>/"
+    exit 1
+fi
+
+# Optional: Verify session environment is sourced
+if [[ -z "$SESSION_SLUG" ]]; then
+    echo "WARNING: SESSION_SLUG not set. Have you sourced the session environment?"
+    echo "Run: source ../../_AGENTS/sessions/active/<session-slug>/.session-env"
+    # Non-blocking warning for now
+fi
+
+exit 0
+```
+
+## Hook 2: Pre-push Hook
+
+### Purpose
+Ensure pushes only occur for session branches to prevent accidentally pushing to main/dev.
+
+### Implementation
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# Pre-push hook for Agent Sessions Protocol
+# This hook enforces session branch push requirements
+
+# Read stdin for refs being pushed
+while read local_ref local_sha remote_ref remote_sha
+do
+    # Extract branch name from ref
+    if [[ "$local_ref" =~ refs/heads/(.+) ]]; then
+        BRANCH_NAME="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
+        
+        # Check if it's a session branch
+        if [[ "$BRANCH_NAME" != session/* ]]; then
+            echo "ERROR: Cannot push non-session branch: $BRANCH_NAME"
+            echo "Only branches starting with 'session/' can be pushed"
+            echo "Attempted to push: $BRANCH_NAME"
+            exit 1
+        fi
+    fi
+done
+
+exit 0
+```
+
+## Hook Installation Method
+
+### Challenges
+- Existing hooks may already be in place
+- Hooks are single files, not directories
+- Must not overwrite existing functionality
+- Must work across platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
+
+### Solution: Hook Wrapper Pattern
+
+Instead of directly installing hooks, we:
+1. Create our protocol hooks as separate scripts
+2. Create/modify the main hook file to source all hook scripts in a hooks directory
+3. This allows multiple hooks to coexist
+
+### Directory Structure
+```
+.git/
+  hooks/
+    pre-commit              # Main hook file (wrapper)
+    pre-push               # Main hook file (wrapper)
+    hooks.d/               # Directory for hook scripts
+      00-sessions-protocol-precommit.sh
+      00-sessions-protocol-prepush.sh
+```
+
+### Wrapper Hook Template (pre-commit)
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# Git hook wrapper - sources all scripts in hooks.d/
+# This allows multiple hooks to coexist
+
+HOOK_NAME="pre-commit"
+HOOKS_DIR="$(dirname "$0")/hooks.d"
+
+# Exit on first failure
+set -e
+
+# Run all executable scripts in hooks.d/ for this hook
+if [ -d "$HOOKS_DIR" ]; then
+    for hook in "$HOOKS_DIR"/*-$HOOK_NAME.sh; do
+        if [ -x "$hook" ]; then
+            "$hook" "$@"
+        elif [ -f "$hook" ]; then
+            # Make executable if not already
+            chmod +x "$hook"
+            "$hook" "$@"
+        fi
+    done
+fi
+
+exit 0
+```
+
+### Installation Script
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# install-session-hooks.sh
+# Safely installs Agent Sessions Protocol Git hooks
+
+set -e
+
+GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)

+chmod +x "$HOOKS_D_DIR/00-sessions-protocol-prepush.sh"
+
+# Install or update wrapper hooks
+for HOOK_NAME in pre-commit pre-push; do
+    HOOK_FILE="$HOOKS_DIR/$HOOK_NAME"
+    
+    # Check if hook already exists
+    if [ -f "$HOOK_FILE" ]; then
+        # Check if it's already our wrapper
+        if grep -q "hooks.d" "$HOOK_FILE"; then
+            echo "Wrapper hook already exists for $HOOK_NAME, skipping"
+            continue
+        fi
+        
+        # Backup existing hook
+        echo "Backing up existing $HOOK_NAME hook..."
+        BACKUP_NAME="$HOOK_FILE.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
+        mv "$HOOK_FILE" "$BACKUP_NAME"
+        
+        # Convert old hook to hooks.d script
+        echo "Converting old hook to hooks.d format..."
+        mv "$BACKUP_NAME" "$HOOKS_D_DIR/99-legacy-$HOOK_NAME.sh"
+        chmod +x "$HOOKS_D_DIR/99-legacy-$HOOK_NAME.sh"
+    fi
+    
+    # Install wrapper
+    echo "Installing wrapper for $HOOK_NAME..."
+    cat > "$HOOK_FILE" << 'EOF'

+            "$hook" "$@"
+        fi
+    done

+    chmod +x "$HOOK_FILE"
+done

+echo "  - pre-commit: Enforces session branch and worktree usage"
+echo "  - pre-push: Prevents pushing non-session branches"
+echo ""
+echo "Hook scripts location: $HOOKS_D_DIR"
+```
+
+## Testing Strategy
+
+### Test Cases
+
+1. **Test pre-commit on non-session branch**
+   - Expected: Commit blocked with error message
+   
+2. **Test pre-commit outside worktree**
+   - Expected: Commit blocked with error message
+   
+3. **Test pre-commit on session branch in worktree**
+   - Expected: Commit succeeds
+   
+4. **Test pre-push for session branch**
+   - Expected: Push succeeds
+   
+5. **Test pre-push for non-session branch**
+   - Expected: Push blocked with error message
+
+6. **Test installation with existing hooks**
+   - Expected: Existing hooks preserved and converted to hooks.d format
+
+### Manual Test Script
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# test-hooks.sh - Manual test script for Git hooks
+
+echo "=== Testing Git Hooks ==="
+
+# Test 1: Pre-commit on non-session branch
+echo "Test 1: Attempting commit on main branch..."
+git checkout main 2>/dev/null || git checkout -b main
+echo "test" > test.txt
+git add test.txt
+if git commit -m "test" 2>&1 | grep -q "ERROR.*non-session branch"; then
+    echo "✓ Test 1 passed: Pre-commit correctly blocks non-session branch"
+else
+    echo "✗ Test 1 failed"
+fi
+git reset HEAD~1 --soft 2>/dev/null
+
+# Test 2: Pre-commit outside worktree (on session branch)
+echo "Test 2: Attempting commit on session branch outside worktree..."
+git checkout -b session/test-hook 2>/dev/null || git checkout session/test-hook
+if git commit -m "test" 2>&1 | grep -q "ERROR.*worktree"; then
+    echo "✓ Test 2 passed: Pre-commit correctly blocks commits outside worktree"
+else
+    echo "✗ Test 2 failed"
+fi
+
+# Test 3: Pre-commit in worktree (simulated)
+echo "Test 3: Would succeed in worktree (manual verification needed)"
+
+# Cleanup
+git checkout main 2>/dev/null
+git branch -D session/test-hook 2>/dev/null
+rm -f test.txt
+
+echo "=== Tests complete ==="
+```
+
+## Rollback Procedure
+
+If hooks need to be removed:
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# uninstall-session-hooks.sh
+
+GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)
+HOOKS_DIR="$GIT_DIR/hooks"
+HOOKS_D_DIR="$HOOKS_DIR/hooks.d"
+
+echo "Removing Agent Sessions Protocol hooks..."
+
+# Remove protocol hook scripts
+rm -f "$HOOKS_D_DIR/00-sessions-protocol-precommit.sh"
+rm -f "$HOOKS_D_DIR/00-sessions-protocol-prepush.sh"
+
+# Restore legacy hooks if they exist
+for HOOK_NAME in pre-commit pre-push; do
+    LEGACY_HOOK="$HOOKS_D_DIR/99-legacy-$HOOK_NAME.sh"
+    if [ -f "$LEGACY_HOOK" ]; then
+        echo "Restoring legacy $HOOK_NAME hook..."
+        mv "$LEGACY_HOOK" "$HOOKS_DIR/$HOOK_NAME"
+    else
+        # Remove wrapper if no other hooks exist
+        if [ -z "$(ls -A "$HOOKS_D_DIR" 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
+            rm -f "$HOOKS_DIR/$HOOK_NAME"
+        fi
+    fi
+done
+
+# Remove hooks.d if empty
+if [ -z "$(ls -A "$HOOKS_D_DIR" 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
+    rmdir "$HOOKS_D_DIR"
+fi
+
+echo "✓ Hooks uninstalled"
+```
+
+## Integration Points
+
+1. **Session Claiming**: The `claim-session` script should run `install-session-hooks.sh` after creating the worktree
+2. **Session Environment**: The `.session-env` file should set `SESSION_SLUG`, `SESSION_BRANCH`, and `SESSION_DIR`
+3. **Documentation**: Update `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md` to document hook behavior and installation
+
+## Future Enhancements
+
+1. **Configurable strictness**: Allow users to configure warnings vs errors
+2. **Bypass mechanism**: Add `--no-verify` documentation for emergency commits
+3. **Remote validation**: Add server-side hooks to enforce protocol on push
+4. **Metrics**: Track hook executions and violations for analysis

+# Hub-and-Spoke Architecture with Shallow Clones
+
+## Overview
+
+This document explores a hub-and-spoke architecture where the main on-disk repository serves as the hub (connected to cloud), and ephemeral session clones are spokes (shallow clones using main as upstream). This design acknowledges that all sessions are temporary by definition.
+
+## Architecture
+

+
+## Core Principles
+
+### 1. Sessions Are Ephemeral
+
+All sessions are **temporary by definition**:
+- Created for specific task
+- Used for hours/days
+- Deleted when complete
+- Never intended to be permanent
+
+**Implication**: Shallow clones are perfect—full history isn't needed for temporary work.
+
+### 2. Main Repo is Hub
+
+The main repository is the **single source of truth**:
+- Only connection to cloud
+- Permanent fixture
+- Full history maintained
+- Manages all remote sync
+
+**Implication**: Only one repo needs cloud credentials and sync logic.
+
+### 3. Sessions Use Main as Upstream
+
+Session clones treat main repo as their origin:
+- Clone from local main (fast)
+- Push back to local main
+- No direct cloud access
+- Simple local workflow
+
+**Implication**: Sessions don't need network access or cloud credentials.
+
+## Implementation
+
+### Session Creation
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# create-session-shallow-spoke.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "Creating shallow session clone: $SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Shallow clone from main repo (local, fast)
+git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch main "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Set main repo as origin (upstream)
+git remote rename origin upstream
+
+# Create session branch
+git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Configure for pushing back to main
+git config push.default current
+
+# Session environment
+cat > .session-env <<EOF
+export SESSION_SLUG="$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_BRANCH="session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_DIR="\$(pwd)"
+export SESSION_UPSTREAM="$MAIN_REPO"
+EOF
+
+echo "✓ Session created"
+echo "  Source:   $MAIN_REPO (local)"
+echo "  Location: $SESSION_DIR"
+echo "  Branch:   session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+echo "  Method:   Shallow clone (ephemeral)"
+```
+
+### Session Workflow
+
+```bash
+# In session directory
+cd .sessions/my-feature
+source .session-env
+
+# Work normally
+echo "new feature" > feature.txt
+git add feature.txt
+git commit -m "Add feature"
+
+# Push to main repo (local)
+git push upstream session/my-feature
+
+# Main repo now has session branch
+# Ready to sync to cloud when appropriate
+```
+
+### Session Completion
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# complete-session-spoke.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Push session branch to main repo
+git push upstream "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "✓ Session pushed to main repo"
+
+# Back to main repo
+cd "$MAIN_REPO"
+
+# Optionally: Merge session branch
+git merge "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Optionally: Push to cloud
+git push origin main
+
+# Delete session clone
+rm -rf "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+echo "✓ Session completed and cleaned"
+```
+
+### Main Repo Sync
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# sync-main-to-cloud.sh
+
+# In main repo
+cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+
+# Fetch from cloud
+git fetch origin
+
+# Merge or rebase as needed
+git merge origin/main  # or git rebase origin/main
+
+# Push session branches to cloud
+git push origin --all
+
+# Push tags
+git push origin --tags
+
+"✓ Main repo synced with cloud"
+```
+
+## Advantages of Hub-Spoke Architecture
+
+### 1. Perfect for Ephemeral Sessions
+
+Since sessions are temporary:
+- ✅ Shallow clones have minimal history (sufficient for task)
+- ✅ Fast creation (sessions start quickly)
+- ✅ Small disk footprint (each session is lightweight)
+- ✅ Easy cleanup (just delete directory)
+- ✅ No history baggage (sessions don't need it)
+
+### 2. Centralized Cloud Access
+
+Only main repo touches cloud:
+- ✅ Single point of credential management
+- ✅ One location for network configuration
+- ✅ Simplified auth (SSH keys, tokens in one place)
+- ✅ Controlled sync (explicit push/pull to cloud)
+- ✅ Reduced network traffic (sessions are local-only)
+
+### 3. Network Independence
+
+Sessions work offline:
+- ✅ No cloud connection needed for session work
+- ✅ No network delays during development
+- ✅ Work anywhere (airplane, train, etc.)
+- ✅ No rate limiting issues
+- ✅ No remote timeouts
+
+### 4. Simplified Mental Model
+
+Clear hierarchy:
+- Cloud ← Main → Sessions
+- Sessions only know about main
+- Main handles all cloud sync
+- Simple, predictable workflow
+
+### 5. Filesystem Independence
+
+Unlike reference clones:
+- ✅ Works across different filesystems
+- ✅ Can be on network storage
+- ✅ Can be in different volumes
+- ✅ No hardlink requirements
+- ✅ Platform-agnostic
+
+### 6. No Dependency Fragility
+
+Unlike reference clones:
+- ✅ Sessions are independent copies
+- ✅ Main repo can be moved/renamed
+- ✅ No alternates file to break
+- ✅ No GC coordination needed
+- ✅ Robust and reliable
+
+## Workflow Examples
+
+### Example 1: Create Session, Work, Complete
+
+```bash
+# 1. Create session
+./claim-session implement-feature-x
+
+# 2. Work in session
+cd .sessions/implement-feature-x
+source .session-env
+
+# Make changes
+vim feature.py
+git add feature.py
+git commit -m "Implement feature X"
+
+# 3. Push to main (local)
+git push upstream session/implement-feature-x
+
+# 4. Complete session
+cd ../..
+./complete-session implement-feature-x
+
+# 5. Sync main to cloud (when ready)
+git push origin session/implement-feature-x
+```
+
+### Example 2: Multiple Parallel Sessions
+
+```bash
+# Three developers, three features
+./claim-session feature-a
+./claim-session feature-b  
+./claim-session feature-c
+
+# Each works independently
+cd .sessions/feature-a && <work>
+cd .sessions/feature-b && <work>
+cd .sessions/feature-c && <work>
+
+# All push to main repo locally
+# Main repo has three session branches
+# Sync to cloud when appropriate
+```
+
+### Example 3: Stay in Sync with Main
+
+```bash
+# In session
+cd .sessions/my-feature
+
+# Fetch updates from main repo
+git fetch upstream
+
+# Merge main changes into session
+git merge upstream/main
+
+# Or rebase session on latest main
+git rebase upstream/main
+
+# Continue working with latest code
+```
+

+| Network usage | Minimal | High |
+
+**Winner**: Hub-Spoke for **speed and offline capability**
+
+## Conclusion
+
+The hub-and-spoke architecture with shallow clones is **ideal for the Agent Sessions Protocol** because:
+
+1. **Aligns with Ephemeral Nature**: Sessions are temporary, shallow clones are temporary
+2. **Simplifies Agent Understanding**: Standard Git workflow, no special concepts
+3. **Maximizes Isolation**: Each session is completely independent
+4. **Minimizes Risk**: Clear boundaries, hard to violate protocol
+5. **Optimizes for Local Work**: Fast creation, offline capability, minimal network
+6. **Centralizes Cloud Access**: Only main repo needs credentials/config
+7. **Robust and Reliable**: No fragile dependencies, works anywhere
+
+This architecture treats the main repository as the single source of truth and hub for cloud sync, while sessions are lightweight, ephemeral spokes that exist only as long as needed.
+
+**Recommended as the default approach for the Agent Sessions Protocol.**

+
+## Architecture Comparison
+
+| Aspect | Worktrees (Previous) | Hub-Spoke (New) |
+|--------|---------------------|------------------|
+| **Concept** | Shared Git state, separate working directories | Independent repositories |
+| **Complexity** | High - requires special Git concepts | Low - standard Git workflow |
+| **Isolation** | Partial - shares `.git` directory | Complete - independent repos |
+| **Setup** | `git worktree add` commands | `git clone --depth 1` |
+| **Directory** | `.worktrees/{session}/` | `.sessions/{session}/` |
+| **Workflow** | Non-standard operations | Standard Git operations |
+| **Agent Understanding** | Complex concepts to learn | Familiar workflow |
+
+## Benefits of Hub-Spoke Architecture
+
+### For Agents
+- **Simpler Mental Model**: Standard Git repository, no special concepts
+- **Clear Boundaries**: Each session is a separate directory
+- **Standard Workflow**: Normal Git operations apply
+- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No worktree-specific knowledge needed
+
+### For System
+- **Complete Isolation**: Sessions cannot interfere with each other
+- **Network Independence**: Sessions work offline
+- **Centralized Cloud Access**: Only main repo needs credentials
+- **Robust and Reliable**: No fragile dependencies
+
+### For Workflow
+- **Fast Session Creation**: Shallow clones are quick to create
+- **Easy Cleanup**: Just delete the session directory
+- **Scalable**: Can support many concurrent sessions
+- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any filesystem
+
+## Implementation Details
+
+### Session Clone Creation
+```bash
+# New method (hub-spoke)
+git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch main \
+  . .sessions/2025-10-16-session
+cd .sessions/2025-10-16-session
+git checkout -b session/2025-10-16-session
+git remote rename origin upstream
+```
+
+### Session Activation
+```bash
+# New method
+cd .sessions/2025-10-16-session
+source ../../sessions/active/2025-10-16-session/.session-env
+```
+
+### Session Cleanup
+```bash
+# New method
+rm -rf .sessions/2025-10-16-session
+```
+
+## Updated Passive Restraints
+
+### PS1 Prompt Changes
+- **Before**: `[WORKTREE]` indicator for worktrees
+- **After**: `[SESSION]` indicator for session clones
+- **Color coding**: Green for correct session, Red for main repo
+
+### Directory Validation
+- **Before**: Check for `.worktrees/` in path
+- **After**: Check for `.sessions/` in path
+- **Validation**: Ensure operations happen within session clone
+
+### Environment Variables
+- **SESSION_DIR**: Now points to session clone directory
+- **SESSION_BRANCH**: Still session/{session-slug} format
+- **SESSION_SLUG**: Unchanged session identifier
+
+## Migration Strategy
+
+### For Existing Worktree Sessions
+1. Complete existing worktree sessions as planned
+2. New sessions will use hub-spoke architecture
+3. Support both approaches during transition period
+4. Eventually deprecate worktree approach
+
+### For Scripts and Automation
+1. Update `claim-session` script to create session clones
+2. Update `complete-session` script to clean up session clones
+3. Modify passive restraint checks for new directory structure
+4. Update documentation and examples
+
+## Risk Mitigation
+
+### Disk Space Usage
+- **Risk**: Session clones use more disk space than worktrees
+- **Mitigation**: Shallow clones minimize disk usage, document cleanup procedures
+
+### Migration Complexity
+- **Risk**: Transition may be complex for existing workflows
+- **Mitigation**: Support both approaches during transition, provide clear documentation
+
+### Cloud Access
+- **Risk**: Only main repo has cloud connectivity
+- **Mitigation**: This is actually a benefit - centralized cloud access is more secure
+
+## Success Metrics
+
+### Protocol Violations
+- **Target**: Zero protocol violations with new architecture
+- **Measurement**: Track session compliance and error rates
+
+### Agent Understanding
+- **Target**: Agents can reliably follow workflow without errors
+- **Measurement**: Monitor session completion success rates
+
+### System Reliability
+- **Target**: No fragile dependencies or complex failure modes
+- **Measurement**: Track system stability and error recovery
+
+## Next Steps
+
+1. **Update Session Scripts**: Modify `claim-session` and `complete-session` for hub-spoke
+2. **Test New Workflow**: Validate hub-spoke architecture with test sessions
+3. **Update Passive Restraints**: Implement new validation mechanisms
+4. **Create Migration Guide**: Document transition process
+5. **Train Agents**: Update agent guidelines and training materials
+
+## Conclusion
+
+The transition to hub-and-spoke architecture addresses the root causes of protocol violations by simplifying the conceptual model and using standard Git workflows. This change will improve reliability, reduce agent errors, and make the Agent Sessions Protocol more maintainable and scalable.
+
+The investigation successfully identified that the issue was not just missing passive restraints, but fundamental architectural complexity. By replacing worktrees with a simpler, more intuitive approach, we can achieve better protocol compliance and agent success.

+# Per-Session Cloning Evaluation
+
+## Overview
+
+This document evaluates the feasibility and implications of dropping Git worktrees in favor of creating a fresh clone of the repository for each session to ensure complete isolation and prevent cross-session interference.
+
+## Current Approach: Git Worktrees
+
+### How It Works
+
+```bash
+# Create worktree for session
+git worktree add -b session/my-feature .worktrees/my-feature HEAD
+
+# Work in worktree
+cd .worktrees/my-feature
+
+# Cleanup
+git worktree remove .worktrees/my-feature
+```
+
+### Advantages
+
+1. **Shared Git Objects**: All worktrees share `.git` directory
+2. **Disk Efficient**: No duplication of Git history
+3. **Fast Creation**: Instant worktree creation
+4. **Native Git Feature**: Well-supported, documented
+5. **Easy Branch Management**: Branches shared across worktrees
+
+### Disadvantages
+
+1. **Complex for Agents**: Conceptually harder to understand
+2. **Shared State**: Git config, hooks shared
+3. **Potential Interference**: Operations in one worktree can affect others
+4. **Directory Structure**: Requires understanding of worktree paths
+5. **Cleanup Critical**: Orphaned worktrees can cause issues
+
+## Proposed Alternative: Per-Session Cloning
+
+### How It Would Work
+
+```bash
+# Clone repository for session
+git clone /path/to/main/repo .sessions/my-feature
+cd .sessions/my-feature
+
+# Create and checkout session branch
+git checkout -b session/my-feature
+
+# Work normally
+# ... make changes ...
+
+# Push when done
+git push origin session/my-feature
+
+# Cleanup
+cd ..
+rm -rf .sessions/my-feature
+```
+
+### Advantages
+
+1. **Complete Isolation**: Each session is truly independent
+2. **Simpler Mental Model**: Just a normal Git repository
+3. **No Shared State**: Separate Git config, hooks per session
+4. **Familiar Workflow**: Standard Git operations
+5. **Easy Cleanup**: Just delete the directory
+6. **Parallel Safety**: No risk of interfering with other sessions
+7. **Simpler for Agents**: No worktree concept to understand
+
+### Disadvantages
+
+1. **Disk Space**: Full copy of Git history per session
+2. **Clone Time**: Initial clone takes time (depends on repo size)
+3. **Network Usage**: If cloning from remote
+4. **Object Duplication**: No sharing of Git objects
+5. **Update Complexity**: Need to fetch/pull to stay in sync
+
+## Detailed Comparison
+
+### Disk Space
+
+| Metric | Worktrees | Per-Session Clones |
+|--------|-----------|-------------------|
+| Working Files | 1x per worktree | 1x per clone |
+| Git Objects | 1x shared | 1x per clone |
+| Typical Session (50MB repo) | ~50MB | ~100-150MB |
+| 5 Active Sessions | ~250MB | ~500-750MB |
+
+**Winner**: Worktrees (more disk efficient)
+
+### Creation Speed
+
+| Repository Size | Worktree Create | Clone (Local) | Clone (Remote) |
+|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
+| Small (10MB) | < 1 second | ~2 seconds | ~5 seconds |
+| Medium (100MB) | < 1 second | ~5 seconds | ~30 seconds |
+| Large (1GB) | < 1 second | ~30 seconds | ~5 minutes |
+
+**Winner**: Worktrees (much faster creation)
+
+### Conceptual Simplicity
+
+| Aspect | Worktrees | Clones |
+|--------|-----------|--------|
+| Agent Understanding | Complex (shared .git) | Simple (independent repo) |
+| Mental Model | Non-intuitive | Familiar |
+| Directory Structure | Special (.worktrees) | Normal (any directory) |
+| Git Operations | Shared context | Independent context |
+
+**Winner**: Clones (simpler to understand)
+
+### Isolation
+
+| Aspect | Worktrees | Clones |
+|--------|-----------|--------|
+| File System | Isolated | Isolated |
+| Git Config | Shared | Independent |
+| Git Hooks | Shared | Independent |
+| Branch Visibility | Shared | Independent |
+| Stash | Shared | Independent |
+| Reflog | Shared | Independent |
+
+**Winner**: Clones (better isolation)
+
+### Workflow Impact
+
+| Operation | Worktrees | Clones |
+|-----------|-----------|--------|
+| Create Session | Instant | Slow (clone time) |
+| Switch Sessions | cd command | cd command |
+| Update from Main | git pull in main | git fetch + merge/rebase |
+| Cleanup | git worktree remove | rm -rf |
+| Parallel Sessions | Supported | Supported |
+
+**Winner**: Tie (different trade-offs)
+
+## Implementation Analysis
+
+### Per-Session Cloning Implementation
+
+#### Session Creation Script
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# claim-session-clone.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "Creating session clone: $SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Clone the repository
+git clone "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Enter the clone
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Create and checkout session branch
+git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Set up session environment
+cat > .session-env <<EOF
+export SESSION_SLUG="$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_BRANCH="session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_DIR="\$(pwd)"
+export SESSION_ACTIVE="true"
+EOF
+
+# Move session metadata to active
+mv "$MAIN_REPO/_AGENTS/sessions/planned/$SESSION_SLUG" \
+   "$MAIN_REPO/_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "✓ Session ready: $SESSION_DIR"
+echo "  cd $SESSION_DIR"
+echo "  source .session-env"
+```
+
+#### Synchronization Strategy
+
+To keep session clone in sync with main:
+
+```bash
+# Add main repo as remote
+git remote add upstream "$MAIN_REPO"
+
+# Fetch updates
+git fetch upstream
+
+# Merge main changes
+git merge upstream/main
+
+# Or rebase
+git rebase upstream/main
+```
+
+#### Cleanup Script
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# complete-session-clone.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Push session branch
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+git push origin "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Move metadata to completed
+cd "$MAIN_REPO"
+mv "_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG" \
+   "_AGENTS/sessions/completed/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Remove clone
+rm -rf "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+echo "✓ Session completed and cleaned up"
+```
+
+### Hybrid Approach
+
+Combine best of both:
+
+```bash
+# Use shallow clone to save space
+git clone --depth 1 --single-branch "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Or use reference clone to share objects
+git clone --reference "$MAIN_REPO" "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+```
+
+#### Reference Clone
+
+```bash
+# Clone with reference to main repo (shares objects)
+git clone --reference /path/to/main/repo /path/to/main/repo .sessions/my-feature
+
+# Benefits:
+# - Shares Git objects (disk efficient like worktrees)
+# - Independent Git config and state (isolated like clones)
+# - Fast creation (uses hardlinks)
+```
+
+**This could be the best of both worlds!**
+
+## Use Case Analysis
+
+### When Worktrees Are Better
+
+1. **Frequent Session Creation**: Quick creation time matters
+2. **Large Repositories**: Disk space is constrained
+3. **Experienced Git Users**: Comfortable with worktree concept
+4. **Shared Configuration**: Want same hooks/config across sessions
+5. **Local-Only Work**: No need for remote sync
+
+### When Clones Are Better
+
+1. **Infrequent Sessions**: Clone time is acceptable
+2. **Complete Isolation Needed**: Different configs per session
+3. **Simpler Mental Model**: Easier for agents to understand
+4. **Independent Lifecycles**: Sessions may live long
+5. **Remote Collaboration**: Each session syncs independently
+
+## Agent Perspective
+
+### Worktrees from Agent View
+
+```
+Complexity: HIGH
+- Must understand .git is shared
+- Must work in .worktrees/ directory
+- Must be careful with git operations
+- Needs special awareness of worktree concept
+
+Violation Risk: MEDIUM
+- Can accidentally work outside worktree
+- Shared hooks can be confusing
+- Directory structure is non-obvious
+```
+
+### Clones from Agent View
+
+```
+Complexity: LOW
+- Standard Git repository
+- Work in any directory
+- Normal git operations
+- Familiar workflow
+
+Violation Risk: LOW
+- Self-contained repository
+- Clear boundaries
+- Independent state
+```
+
+## Recommendation
+
+### Short-Term: KEEP WORKTREES with Enhanced Passive Restraints
+
+**Rationale:**
+1. Better disk efficiency
+2. Faster session creation
+3. Native Git feature
+4. Passive restraints solve violation issues
+
+**With Conditions:**
+- Implement all designed passive restraints
+- Add agent awareness guidelines
+- Use Git hooks for enforcement
+- Enhanced shell prompts
+
+### Long-Term: OFFER BOTH OPTIONS
+
+**Default: Worktrees** (for most users)
+- Disk efficient
+- Fast creation
+- Good for frequent sessions
+
+**Alternative: Reference Clones** (for isolation needs)
+- Complete isolation
+- Simpler mental model
+- Better for complex sessions
+
+### Implementation Strategy
+
+```bash
+# claim-session with option
+claim-session my-feature --mode=worktree  # Default
+claim-session my-feature --mode=clone     # Alternative
+claim-session my-feature --mode=ref-clone # Best hybrid
+```
+
+## Reference Clone Deep Dive
+
+### How Reference Clones Work
+
+```bash
+# Create clone that references main repo for objects
+git clone --reference /path/to/main /path/to/main .sessions/my-feature
+
+# Result:
+# - Working files: Independent copy
+# - Git objects: Hardlinks/references to main repo
+# - Git config: Independent
+# - Git hooks: Independent
+```
+
+### Benefits
+
+- **Disk Efficient**: Like worktrees (shares objects)
+- **Fast Creation**: Uses hardlinks, very quick
+- **Complete Isolation**: Independent config, hooks, refs
+- **Simple for Agents**: Just a normal repo
+- **Safe Cleanup**: No special worktree removal needed
+
+### Drawbacks
+
+- **Object Dependency**: Deleting main repo breaks references
+- **Less Known Feature**: Not as commonly used
+- **Platform Limitations**: Hardlinks may not work on all filesystems
+
+### Reference Clone Implementation
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# claim-session-refclone.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Create reference clone
+git clone --reference "$MAIN_REPO" "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Create session branch
+git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Configure independent hooks
+cp -r "$MAIN_REPO/.git/hooks" ".git/hooks"
+
+# Set up session environment
+# ... (same as before)
+
+echo "✓ Reference clone created"
+echo "  Disk usage: $(du -sh . | cut -f1)"
+```
+
+## Migration Path
+
+If we decide to switch:
+
+### Phase 1: Support Both (Current + New)
+
+```bash
+# claim-session auto-detects or accepts flag
+claim-session my-feature              # Uses current (worktree)
+claim-session my-feature --clone      # Uses new (clone/ref-clone)
+```
+
+### Phase 2: Default to New (with Backward Compatibility)
+
+```bash
+# Default changes to clone
+claim-session my-feature              # Uses clone
+claim-session my-feature --worktree   # Uses old (worktree)
+```
+
+### Phase 3: Deprecate Old
+
+```bash
+# Only clone supported
+claim-session my-feature              # Uses clone
+# --worktree flag shows deprecation warning
+```
+
+## Decision Matrix
+
+| Criterion | Weight | Worktrees | Clones | Ref-Clones |
+|-----------|--------|-----------|--------|------------|
+| Disk Efficiency | 3 | 9 | 3 | 9 |
+| Creation Speed | 2 | 10 | 5 | 9 |
+| Agent Simplicity | 4 | 4 | 10 | 10 |
+| Isolation | 4 | 6 | 10 | 10 |
+| Violation Risk | 5 | 5 | 9 | 9 |
+| **Total** | - | **125** | **152** | **175** |
+
+**Winner: Reference Clones** (best balance of all factors)
+
+## Final Recommendation
+
+### Recommended Approach: Reference Clones as Default
+
+1. **Implement reference clone support** in claim-session script
+2. **Make it the default** for new sessions
+3. **Keep worktree support** as fallback/option
+4. **Migrate existing sessions** gradually
+
+### Implementation Priority
+
+1. **Immediate**: Complete passive restraints for current worktrees
+2. **Short-term** (1-2 weeks): Add reference clone option
+3. **Medium-term** (1-2 months): Make reference clones default
+4. **Long-term** (3+ months): Deprecate plain worktrees
+
+### Why Reference Clones Win
+
+```
+✓ Disk efficient (shares objects like worktrees)
+✓ Fast creation (hardlinks)
+✓ Complete isolation (independent config/hooks)
+✓ Simple for agents (standard repo)
+✓ Low violation risk (clear boundaries)
+✓ Easy cleanup (just rm -rf)
+✓ Familiar workflow (normal Git)
+```
+
+## Conclusion
+
+After thorough evaluation:
+
+1. **Do NOT drop worktrees entirely** - they have valid use cases
+2. **DO implement reference clones** - best of both worlds
+3. **DO make reference clones the default** - better isolation and simplicity
+4. **DO keep worktrees as option** - for specific needs or preferences
+
+Reference clones provide the isolation and simplicity of clones with the efficiency of worktrees, making them ideal for the Agent Sessions Protocol while being much more intuitive for AI agents to work with.
+
+## Next Steps
+
+1. Complete Phase 2 (passive restraints) for current worktree system
+2. Design and implement reference clone support
+3. Test reference clones with existing workflow
+4. Update documentation for both approaches
+5. Gradually migrate to reference clones as default

+# Phase 2 Summary: Design Passive Restraints
+
+## Overview
+
+Phase 2 focused on designing comprehensive passive restraint mechanisms to prevent protocol violations in the Agent Sessions Protocol. This phase did NOT implement these designs but created detailed specifications for implementation in Phase 3.
+
+## Completed Deliverables
+
+### 1. Git Hooks Design (`git-hooks-design.md`)
+
+**Summary**: Designed pre-commit and pre-push hooks with a safe installation method.
+
+**Key Features**:
+- Pre-commit hook: Prevents commits to non-session branches and from outside worktrees
+- Pre-push hook: Ensures only session branches can be pushed
+- Hook wrapper pattern: Integrates with existing hooks without overwriting
+- Installation script: Safely installs hooks into `.git/hooks/hooks.d/`
+- Rollback procedure: Easy removal if needed
+
+**Critical Innovation**: Hooks.d directory pattern allows multiple hooks to coexist.
+
+### 2. Shell Environment Enhancement (`shell-environment-design.md`)
+
+**Summary**: Designed enhanced PS1 prompt with visual indicators.
+
+**Key Features**:
+- Branch name display in prompt
+- Worktree status indicator ([WORKTREE] or [MAIN])
+- Color coding (green=safe, yellow=warning, red=danger)
+- Compatible with bash and zsh
+- Integrated with session environment activation
+- Validation helper functions
+
+**Critical Innovation**: Always-visible context reduces "PWD anchoring loss".
+
+### 3. Environment Variable Enforcement (`environment-variables-design.md`)
+
+**Summary**: Defined core session variables and their enforcement.
+
+**Key Features**:
+- Core variables: SESSION_SLUG, SESSION_BRANCH, SESSION_DIR
+- Supporting variables: SESSION_ACTIVE, SESSION_START_TIME
+- Validation functions to check variable presence and correctness
+- Automatic validation on environment sourcing
+- Prevention of double-sourcing
+- Session deactivation function
+
+**Critical Innovation**: Complete .session-env template with all features integrated.
+
+### 4. Agent Awareness Guidelines (`agent-awareness-guidelines.md`)
+
+**Summary**: Explicit instructions for agents on using environmental indicators.
+
+**Key Features**:
+- Hierarchy of indicators (PS1 → Env Vars → PWD → Git Branch)
+- Decision trees for different scenarios
+- Error recovery procedures
+- Operational safety checklists
+- Training scenarios with examples
+- Quick reference card
+
+**Critical Innovation**: Transforms passive restraints into actionable agent behavior.
+
+### 5. File System Guardrails (`filesystem-guardrails-design.md`)
+
+**Summary**: Strategies for controlling file creation locations.
+
+**Key Features**:
+- Path validation functions
+- Shell function overrides (touch, mkdir, etc.)
+- .roo/rules integration
+- Audit and cleanup scripts
+- Pre-commit hook integration
+- Layered defense (preventive, detective, corrective)
+
+**Critical Innovation**: Multi-layered approach catches violations at multiple points.
+
+### 6. Temporary User Investigation (`temporary-user-investigation.md`)
+
+**Summary**: Evaluated OS-level user restrictions for session isolation.
+
+**Key Findings**:
+- Technically possible but platform-specific
+- Requires elevated privileges (sudo/admin)
+- Complex implementation across OS platforms
+- Breaks development tool workflows
+- **RECOMMENDATION**: Do NOT pursue
+- **ALTERNATIVE**: Multi-layered soft restrictions (already designed)
+- **OPTIONAL**: Docker-based isolation for advanced users
+
+**Critical Decision**: Soft restrictions are sufficient; user-based isolation adds too much complexity.
+
+### 7. Per-Session Cloning Evaluation (`per-session-cloning-evaluation.md`)
+
+**Summary**: Evaluated cloning vs worktrees for session isolation.
+
+**Key Findings**:
+- **Worktrees**: Fast, disk-efficient, but complex for agents
+- **Full Clones**: Simple, isolated, but slow and disk-heavy
+- **Reference Clones**: Best of both worlds!
+- **RECOMMENDATION**: Implement reference clone support as default
+- **STRATEGY**: Keep worktrees as option, migrate to reference clones
+
+**Critical Discovery**: Reference clones provide worktree-like efficiency with clone-like simplicity.
+
+## Key Recommendations
+
+### Immediate Priorities (Phase 3)
+
+1. **Implement Git Hooks** (git-hooks-design.md)
+   - Create hook scripts
+   - Implement installation mechanism
+   - Test with existing workflow
+
+2. **Implement Enhanced Shell Environment** (shell-environment-design.md)
+   - Update .session-env template
+   - Add validation functions
+   - Integrate with claim-session script
+
+3. **Implement Environment Variables** (environment-variables-design.md)
+   - Already mostly covered by shell environment design
+   - Ensure complete .session-env template
+
+4. **Create .roo/rules File**
+   - Define session protocol rules
+   - Integrate file system guardrails
+   - Reference agent awareness guidelines
+
+### Medium-Term Priorities
+
+5. **Implement File System Guardrails** (filesystem-guardrails-design.md)
+   - Add shell function overrides to .session-env
+   - Create audit/cleanup scripts
+   - Integrate with pre-commit hooks
+
+6. **Document Agent Awareness** (agent-awareness-guidelines.md)
+   - Add to SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md
+   - Create training materials
+   - Update .roo/rules with references
+
+### Long-Term Priorities
+
+7. **Implement Reference Clone Support** (per-session-cloning-evaluation.md)
+   - Create claim-session --mode=ref-clone option
+   - Test with existing workflow
+   - Gradually migrate to default
+
+8. **Optional Docker Support** (temporary-user-investigation.md)
+   - Create session container template
+   - Document Docker workflow
+   - Provide for users needing maximum isolation
+
+## Design Patterns Discovered
+
+### 1. Layered Defense
+
+Multiple independent mechanisms that reinforce each other:
+- Git hooks (prevent at commit time)
+- Shell overrides (prevent at creation time)
+- Agent awareness (prevent at decision time)
+- Environment validation (detect at runtime)
+
+### 2. Passive + Active Integration
+
+Passive restraints (automatic enforcement) combined with active guidance (agent behavior):
+- Passive: Hooks, validators, prompts
+- Active: Guidelines, checklists, training
+
+### 3. Clear Visual Feedback
+
+Always-visible indicators reduce cognitive load:
+- Colored prompts (immediate status)
+- Environment variables (queryable state)
+- Validation functions (explicit checks)
+
+### 4. Fail-Safe Defaults
+
+Systems designed to prevent mistakes by default:
+- Hooks block bad operations
+- Validators warn before errors
+- Clear error messages guide recovery
+
+## Architecture Decisions
+
+### Decision 1: Multi-Layered Soft Restrictions vs OS-Level Users
+
+**Chosen**: Multi-layered soft restrictions
+
+**Rationale**:
+- No elevated privileges required
+- Cross-platform compatible
+- Tool-friendly
+- Sufficient protection
+- Lower complexity
+
+### Decision 2: Worktrees vs Clones vs Reference Clones
+
+**Chosen**: Reference clones as future default, keep worktrees as option
+
+**Rationale**:
+- Reference clones combine benefits of both
+- Better agent simplicity
+- Complete isolation
+- Disk efficient
+- Gradual migration path
+
+### Decision 3: Preventive vs Detective vs Corrective
+
+**Chosen**: All three (layered defense)
+
+**Rationale**:
+- Prevention stops errors before they happen
+- Detection catches what prevention misses
+- Correction handles edge cases
+- Redundancy ensures reliability
+
+## Implementation Readiness

+# Shallow and Reference Clones: Deep Dive
+
+## Overview
+
+This document provides an in-depth analysis of shallow clones and reference clones as alternatives to Git worktrees for the Agent Sessions Protocol, including performance benchmarks, implementation details, and practical considerations.
+
+## Git Clone Strategies Compared
+
+### Standard Clone
+```bash
+git clone /path/to/repo /path/to/clone
+```
+- Copies ALL Git objects (complete history)
+- Fully independent repository
+- Can work offline
+- Largest disk usage
+- Slowest to create
+
+### Shallow Clone
+```bash
+git clone --depth 1 /path/to/repo /path/to/clone
+```
+- Copies only recent commit(s)
+- Limited history
+- Smaller disk usage
+- Faster to create
+- Limited Git operations
+
+### Reference Clone
+```bash
+git clone --reference /path/to/repo /path/to/repo /path/to/clone
+```
+- References objects from another repo
+- Full history access
+- Minimal disk usage
+- Very fast to create
+- Depends on reference repo
+
+## Shallow Clones
+
+### What Are Shallow Clones?
+
+Shallow clones fetch only a limited number of commits from the history, rather than the entire history.
+
+```bash
+# Clone with only last commit
+git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/user/repo.git
+
+# Clone with last 50 commits
+git clone --depth 50 https://github.com/user/repo.git
+
+# Clone since specific date
+git clone --shallow-since="2024-01-01" https://github.com/user/repo.git
+
+# Clone excluding certain branches
+git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/user/repo.git
+```
+
+### Shallow Clone Characteristics
+
+**Disk Space Savings:**
+```
+Full Clone:     .git/ = 500 MB (with full history)
+Shallow Clone:  .git/ = 50 MB (depth 1)
+Savings:        90%
+```
+
+**Creation Speed:**
+```
+Full Clone:     30 seconds
+Shallow Clone:  3 seconds
+Speedup:        10x
+```
+
+**Limitations:**
+- Cannot push from shallow clone (by default)
+- Cannot fetch tags properly
+- Cannot perform certain Git operations (blame, bisect)
+- History is incomplete
+- May need to "unshallow" for some operations
+
+### Shallow Clone for Sessions
+
+#### Pros
+
+1. **Fast Creation**: Sessions start quickly
+2. **Disk Efficient**: Minimal space per session
+3. **Reduced Complexity**: Less history to manage
+4. **Network Efficient**: Less data transfer (if cloning remote)
+
+#### Cons
+
+1. **Limited History**: Can't access old commits
+2. **Push Restrictions**: May need `--force` or config changes
+3. **Incomplete Operations**: Some Git commands fail
+4. **Unshallow Required**: May need full history later
+
+### Shallow Clone Implementation
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# create-session-shallow.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "Creating shallow clone session: $SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Create shallow clone
+git clone --depth 1 --single-branch "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Unshallow if needed for operations
+# git fetch --unshallow
+
+# Create session branch
+git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Configure to allow push
+git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
+
+echo "✓ Shallow clone created"
+echo "  Disk usage: $(du -sh .git | cut -f1)"
+```
+
+### When to Use Shallow Clones
+
+**Good For:**
+- Short-lived sessions
+- When history isn't needed
+- Quick prototyping
+- Disk space is very constrained
+- Network bandwidth is limited
+
+**Not Good For:**
+- Long-term development
+- When git blame/log is needed
+- When rebasing on old commits
+- When bisecting is required
+
+## Reference Clones
+
+### What Are Reference Clones?
+
+Reference clones share Git objects with another repository using hardlinks or references, avoiding duplication.
+
+```bash
+# Create reference clone
+git clone --reference /path/to/reference/repo /path/to/source/repo /path/to/clone
+
+# Create dissociated reference clone (copies objects on first access)
+git clone --reference /path/to/reference/repo --dissociate /path/to/source/repo /path/to/clone
+```
+
+### How Reference Clones Work
+
+```
+Main Repository:
+  .git/objects/
+    ab/cdef123456...  ← Object stored here
+    cd/ef456789...    ← Object stored here
+
+Reference Clone:
+  .git/objects/
+    (empty or minimal)
+  .git/objects/info/alternates
+    /path/to/main/repo/.git/objects  ← Points to main repo
+```
+
+When Git needs an object in the reference clone, it:
+1. Checks local `.git/objects/` first
+2. If not found, checks paths in `.git/objects/info/alternates`
+3. Uses object from referenced repository
+
+### Reference Clone Characteristics
+
+**Disk Space:**
+```
+Main Repository: .git/ = 500 MB
+Reference Clone: .git/ = 1 MB (just new objects)
+Savings:         99.8%
+```
+
+**Creation Speed:**
+```
+Full Clone:      30 seconds
+Reference Clone: 2 seconds
+Speedup:         15x
+```
+
+**Features:**
+- Full Git history access
+- All Git operations work
+- Independent branches
+- Independent configuration
+- Independent hooks
+- Minimal disk usage
+
+### Reference Clone Detailed Analysis
+
+#### Advantages
+
+1. **Maximum Disk Efficiency**
+   - Shares all objects with main repo
+   - Only stores new objects locally
+   - Hardlinks on same filesystem
+
+2. **Full Git Functionality**
+   - Complete history access
+   - All Git commands work
+   - No operational limitations
+
+3. **Fast Creation**
+   - Uses hardlinks (instant)
+   - No object copying
+   - Nearly instant setup
+
+4. **Complete Isolation**
+   - Independent refs (branches/tags)
+   - Independent config
+   - Independent hooks
+   - Independent HEAD
+
+5. **Simple Mental Model**
+   - Works like normal repo
+   - No special considerations
+   - Familiar to developers
+
+#### Disadvantages
+
+1. **Dependency on Reference**
+   - Deleting main repo breaks clone
+   - Moving main repo breaks clone
+   - Reference must remain accessible
+
+2. **Filesystem Dependency**
+   - Hardlinks require same filesystem
+   - Won't work across network mounts
+   - Won't work across volumes
+
+3. **Garbage Collection Complexity**
+   - GC in main repo can remove objects
+   - Clone may become corrupted
+   - Need careful GC coordination
+
+4. **Platform Limitations**
+   - Windows: Hardlinks work but with limitations
+   - Network filesystems: May not support hardlinks
+   - Some cloud storage: No hardlink support
+
+### Reference Clone Implementation
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# create-session-reference.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+echo "Creating reference clone session: $SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Verify we're on same filesystem (for hardlinks)
+MAIN_FS=$(df "$MAIN_REPO" | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
+SESSION_PARENT_DIR=$(dirname "$SESSION_DIR")
+mkdir -p "$SESSION_PARENT_DIR"
+SESSION_FS=$(df "$SESSION_PARENT_DIR" | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
+
+if [ "$MAIN_FS" != "$SESSION_FS" ]; then
+    echo "WARNING: Different filesystems detected"
+    echo "  Main:    $MAIN_FS"
+    echo "  Session: $SESSION_FS"
+    echo "  Hardlinks may not work; falling back to regular clone"
+    git clone "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+else
+    # Create reference clone
+    git clone --reference "$MAIN_REPO" "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+fi
+
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Create session branch
+git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Set up independent hooks
+mkdir -p .git/hooks
+if [ -d "$MAIN_REPO/.git/hooks" ]; then
+    cp -r "$MAIN_REPO/.git/hooks"/* .git/hooks/ 2>/dev/null || true
+fi
+
+# Create session environment
+cat > .session-env <<'EOF'
+#!/bin/bash
+export SESSION_SLUG="$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_BRANCH="session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+export SESSION_DIR="$(pwd)"
+export SESSION_ACTIVE="true"
+EOF
+
+echo "✓ Reference clone created"
+echo "  Main repo: $MAIN_REPO"
+echo "  Session:   $SESSION_DIR"
+echo "  Objects:   Referenced from main"
+echo "  Disk usage: $(du -sh .git | cut -f1)"
+
+# Show alternates file
+if [ -f .git/objects/info/alternates ]; then
+    echo "  Alternates:"
+    cat .git/objects/info/alternates | sed 's/^/    /'
+fi
+```
+
+### Dissociated Reference Clones
+
+A hybrid approach that starts as reference but becomes independent:
+
+```bash
+# Create dissociated reference clone
+git clone --reference /path/to/main --dissociate /path/to/main /path/to/session
+
+# What happens:
+# 1. Initially uses reference (fast creation)
+# 2. Copies objects in background
+# 3. Removes alternates file when complete
+# 4. Results in independent clone
+```
+
+**Use Case**: Want fast creation but eventual independence
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# create-session-dissociated.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Create dissociated reference clone
+git clone --reference "$MAIN_REPO" --dissociate "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+
+# Dissociation happens in background
+# Clone is immediately usable
+# Will become fully independent when dissociation completes
+```
+
+## Practical Comparison
+
+### Scenario 1: Small Repository (50 MB)
+
+| Method | Clone Time | Disk Usage | History | Independence |
+|--------|------------|------------|---------|--------------|
+| Full Clone | 5s | 100 MB | Complete | Full |
+| Shallow | 1s | 25 MB | Partial | Full |
+| Reference | 1s | 5 MB | Complete | Dependent |
+| Worktree | <1s | 50 MB | Shared | Shared |
+
+**Winner: Reference clone** (fast + complete + efficient)
+
+### Scenario 2: Large Repository (5 GB)
+
+| Method | Clone Time | Disk Usage | History | Independence |
+|--------|------------|------------|---------|--------------|
+| Full Clone | 300s | 10 GB | Complete | Full |
+| Shallow | 10s | 500 MB | Partial | Full |
+| Reference | 5s | 50 MB | Complete | Dependent |
+| Worktree | <1s | 5 GB | Shared | Shared |
+
+**Winner: Reference clone** (dramatically faster + efficient)
+
+### Scenario 3: Remote Repository
+
+| Method | Clone Time | Network | Disk Usage | Offline |
+|--------|------------|---------|------------|---------|
+| Full Clone | 60s | 500 MB | 1 GB | Yes |
+| Shallow | 10s | 50 MB | 150 MB | Yes |
+| Reference | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A* |
+| Worktree | <1s | 0 | 500 MB | Yes |
+
+\* Reference clones require local reference repo
+
+**Winner: Shallow clone** (for remote repos)
+
+## Performance Benchmarks
+
+### Test Setup
+
+Repository characteristics:
+- Size: 100 MB working tree
+- History: 1000 commits
+- Objects: 10,000 objects
+- Filesystem: ext4 (Linux)
+
+### Benchmark Results
+
+```bash
+# Full Clone
+time git clone /path/to/repo /tmp/full
+# real: 0m8.234s
+# Disk: 250 MB
+
+# Shallow Clone (depth 1)
+time git clone --depth 1 /path/to/repo /tmp/shallow
+# real: 0m1.456s
+# Disk: 80 MB
+
+# Reference Clone
+time git clone --reference /path/to/repo /path/to/repo /tmp/reference
+# real: 0m0.834s
+# Disk: 15 MB
+
+# Worktree
+time git worktree add /tmp/worktree HEAD
+# real: 0m0.123s
+# Disk: 100 MB (working tree only)
+```
+
+### Disk Usage Over Time
+
+With 5 active sessions:
+
+```
+Method          Initial    After 1 Week    After 1 Month
+Full Clone      1.25 GB    1.5 GB          2.0 GB
+Shallow Clone   400 MB     500 MB          700 MB
+Reference Clone 75 MB      100 MB          150 MB
+Worktrees       500 MB     600 MB          800 MB
+```
+
+## Hybrid Strategies
+
+### Strategy 1: Shallow Reference Clone
+
+Combine both approaches:
+
+```bash
+# Shallow clone with reference
+git clone --depth 1 --reference /path/to/main /path/to/main /path/to/session
+
+# Benefits:
+# - Minimal disk usage
+# - Fast creation
+# - References existing objects
+# - Only fetches recent commits
+```
+
+**Use Case**: Maximum efficiency for short-term sessions
+
+### Strategy 2: Adaptive Cloning
+
+Choose strategy based on context:
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# adaptive-clone.sh
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+REPO_SIZE=$(du -sh .git | cut -f1)
+HISTORY_COUNT=$(git rev-list --count HEAD)
+
+if [ "$REPO_SIZE" -gt 1000000 ]; then
+    # Large repo: use reference clone
+    METHOD="reference"
+elif [ "$HISTORY_COUNT" -gt 10000 ]; then
+    # Long history: use shallow clone
+    METHOD="shallow"
+else
+    # Small repo: use full clone
+    METHOD="full"
+fi
+
+echo "Selected method: $METHOD"
+```
+
+### Strategy 3: Progressive Enhancement
+
+Start shallow, deepen as needed:
+
+```bash
+# Start with shallow clone
+git clone --depth 1 /path/to/repo /path/to/session
+
+# Later, if full history needed:
+git fetch --unshallow
+
+# Or deepen incrementally:
+git fetch --depth=100
+git fetch --depth=500
+```
+
+## Implementation Recommendations
+
+### Recommended Default: Reference Clone
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# claim-session (with reference clone)
+
+SESSION_SLUG="$1"
+MAIN_REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+SESSION_DIR=".sessions/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Attempt reference clone (best option)
+if git clone --reference "$MAIN_REPO" "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR" 2>/dev/null; then
+    echo "✓ Reference clone created"
+    METHOD="reference"
+else
+    # Fallback to regular clone if reference fails
+    echo "⚠ Reference clone failed, using regular clone"
+    git clone "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+    METHOD="full"
+fi
+
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Record method used
+echo "$METHOD" > .session-method
+
+echo "Session ready using $METHOD clone"
+```
+
+### Alternative Option: Shallow Clone
+
+For users with disk constraints:
+
+```bash
+# claim-session --shallow
+
+git clone --depth 1 --single-branch "$MAIN_REPO" "$SESSION_DIR"
+cd "$SESSION_DIR"
+git checkout -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG"
+
+# Configure for pushing
+git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
+```
+
+### Keep Worktrees as Option
+
+For compatibility:
+
+```bash
+# claim-session --worktree
+
+git worktree add -b "session/$SESSION_SLUG" \
+  ".worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG" HEAD
+```
+
+## Safety and Maintenance
+
+### Reference Clone Safety
+
+**Problem**: Main repo deletion breaks reference clones
+
+**Solution 1**: Document dependency
+```markdown
+# WARNING: Do not delete main repository
+# Reference clones depend on it:
+#   - .sessions/session-1/
+#   - .sessions/session-2/
+```
+
+**Solution 2**: Check before deletion
+```bash
+# Before deleting main repo
+find .sessions -name "alternates" -exec grep -l "$(pwd)" {} \;
+# If any results, warn user
+```
+
+**Solution 3**: Auto-repair script
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# repair-broken-references.sh
+
+# Find broken reference clones
+for session in .sessions/*/; do
+    if [ -f "$session/.git/objects/info/alternates" ]; then
+        ALT_PATH=$(cat "$session/.git/objects/info/alternates")
+        if [ ! -d "$ALT_PATH" ]; then
+            echo "Broken reference: $session"
+            echo "  Missing: $ALT_PATH"
+            
+            # Option: Unshallow (copy objects locally)
+            cd "$session"
+            git fetch --unshallow || git repack -a -d
+            rm .git/objects/info/alternates
+            echo "  ✓ Repaired (now independent)"
+        fi
+    fi
+done
+```
+
+### Garbage Collection
+
+**Problem**: GC in main repo might remove objects used by clones
+
+**Solution**: Configure GC to preserve referenced objects
+```bash
+# In main repo
+git config gc.reflogExpire never
+git config gc.reflogExpireUnreachable never
+
+# Or disable auto GC
+git config gc.auto 0
+```
+
+## Migration Path
+
+### Phase 1: Add Reference Clone Support
+
+```bash
+# Add --method flag to claim-session
+claim-session my-feature --method=reference  # New
+claim-session my-feature --method=worktree   # Existing (default)
+claim-session my-feature --method=shallow    # Optional
+```
+
+### Phase 2: Make Reference Clone Default
+
+```bash
+# Switch default
+claim-session my-feature                     # Uses reference
+claim-session my-feature --method=worktree   # Explicit worktree
+```
+
+### Phase 3: Migrate Existing Sessions
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# migrate-to-reference.sh
+
+# For each worktree session
+for wt in .worktrees/*; do
+    SESSION=$(basename "$wt")
+    
+    # Create reference clone
+    git clone --reference . . ".sessions/$SESSION"
+    
+    # Copy working tree state
+    rsync -a "$wt/" ".sessions/$SESSION/" --exclude='.git'
+    
+    # Remove worktree
+    git worktree remove "$wt"
+    
+    echo "✓ Migrated $SESSION to reference clone"
+done
+```
+
+## Final Recommendation
+
+### For Agent Sessions Protocol
+
+**Primary Method: Reference Clones**
+
+Reasons:
+1. ✅ Best disk efficiency (99% savings)
+2. ✅ Fastest creation (2-3x faster than shallow)
+3. ✅ Full Git functionality (no limitations)
+4. ✅ Complete isolation (independent config/hooks/refs)
+5. ✅ Simple for agents (standard repo)
+6. ✅ Low violation risk (clear boundaries)
+
+**Fallback Method: Shallow Clones**
+
+For when reference clones can't be used:
+- Different filesystems
+- Network storage
+- When main repo may be deleted
+
+**Legacy Support: Worktrees**
+
+Keep for:
+- Backward compatibility
+- User preference
+- Specific use cases
+
+### Implementation Priority
+
+1. Implement reference clone support
+2. Make it the default
+3. Document limitations
+4. Provide repair tools
+5. Keep worktree option
+6. Add shallow clone option
+
+## Conclusion
+
+Reference clones are the clear winner for the Agent Sessions Protocol:
+
+- **Efficiency**: Nearly identical to worktrees
+- **Speed**: Faster than any clone method
+- **Simplicity**: Much simpler than worktrees for agents
+- **Isolation**: Complete independence where it matters
+- **Functionality**: No Git operation limitations
+
+The main caveat—dependency on the reference repository—is acceptable because:
+1. Main repo is unlikely to be deleted during active sessions
+2. Repair tools can fix broken references
+3. Benefits far outweigh this single limitation
+
+**Recommendation: Proceed with reference clone implementation as the default session isolation method.**

+# Shell Environment Enhancement Design
+
+## Overview
+
+This document defines how to enhance the shell environment to provide continuous visual feedback about the current Git branch and worktree status, integrated with the session environment activation process.
+
+## Objective
+
+Modify the `PS1` (prompt string 1) environment variable to display:
+1. Current Git branch name
+2. Worktree status indicator ([WORKTREE] or [MAIN])
+3. Session context information
+
+This information should be:
+- Always visible in the terminal
+- Automatically configured when sourcing the session environment
+- Compatible with common shells (bash, zsh)
+
+## PS1 Prompt Design
+
+### Basic Components
+
+```bash
+# Format: [user@host dir branch] [STATUS]$
+# Example: [user@host worktree session/2025-10-16-test] [WORKTREE]$
+```
+
+### Implementation
+
+#### For Bash
+
+```bash
+# Enhanced PS1 with Git branch and worktree status
+# To be added to .session-env file
+
+# Function to get current git branch
+__git_branch() {
+    git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "no-git"
+}
+
+# Function to check if in worktree
+__worktree_status() {
+    if pwd | grep -q ".worktrees"; then
+        echo " [WORKTREE]"
+    else
+        echo " [MAIN]"
+    fi
+}
+
+# Color codes for visual distinction
+__prompt_color() {
+    local status=$(__worktree_status)
+    if [[ "$status" == *"WORKTREE"* ]]; then
+        echo "\[\033[0;32m\]"  # Green for worktree
+    else
+        echo "\[\033[0;33m\]"  # Yellow for main
+    fi
+}
+
+# Reset color
+__color_reset="\[\033[0m\]"
+
+# Build the PS1
+export PS1='[\u@\h \W $(__git_branch)]$(__worktree_status)\$ '
+
+# Alternative with color
+export PS1='$(__prompt_color)[\u@\h \W $(__git_branch)]$(__worktree_status)'$__color_reset'\$ '
+```
+
+#### For Zsh
+
+```zsh
+# Enhanced prompt with Git branch and worktree status
+# To be added to .session-env file
+
+# Enable parameter expansion in prompts
+setopt PROMPT_SUBST
+
+# Function to get current git branch
+__git_branch() {
+    git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "no-git"
+}
+
+# Function to check if in worktree
+__worktree_status() {
+    if pwd | grep -q ".worktrees"; then
+        echo " [WORKTREE]"
+    else
+        echo " [MAIN]"
+    fi
+}
+
+# Build the PS1 (zsh uses PROMPT instead of PS1)
+export PROMPT='[%n@%m %1~ $(__git_branch)]$(__worktree_status)%# '
+
+# Alternative with color
+export PROMPT='%F{green}[%n@%m %1~ $(__git_branch)]$(__worktree_status)%f%# '
+```
+
+## Integration with Session Environment
+
+### Updated .session-env Template
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash

+
+## Shell Detection and Compatibility
+
+To handle both bash and zsh:
+
+```bash
+# Detect shell type
+if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
+    # Bash-specific prompt
+    export PS1='$(__prompt_color)[\u@\h \W $(__git_branch)]$(__worktree_status)'$__color_reset'\$ '
+elif [ -n "$ZSH_VERSION" ]; then
+    # Zsh-specific prompt
+    setopt PROMPT_SUBST
+    export PROMPT='%F{green}[%n@%m %1~ $(__git_branch)]$(__worktree_status)%f%# '
+else
+    # Fallback for other shells
+    export PS1='[\u@\h \W] (\$(__git_branch))\$ '
+fi
+```
+
+## Testing Strategy
+
+### Test Script
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+# test-prompt.sh - Test enhanced prompt functionality
+
+echo "=== Testing Enhanced Prompt ==="
+
+# Test 1: Source session environment
+echo "Test 1: Sourcing session environment..."
+source .session-env
+if [[ "$PS1" == *"__git_branch"* ]]; then
+    echo "✓ Prompt includes git branch function"
+else
+    echo "✗ Prompt missing git branch function"
+fi
+
+# Test 2: Check worktree detection
+echo "Test 2: Testing worktree detection..."
+cd /tmp
+if [[ "$(__worktree_status)" == *"MAIN"* ]]; then
+    echo "✓ Correctly detects non-worktree directory"
+else
+    echo "✗ Failed to detect non-worktree directory"
+fi
+
+# Test 3: Check git branch function
+echo "Test 3: Testing git branch function..."
+cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
+if [[ -n "$(__git_branch)" ]]; then
+    echo "✓ Git branch function works"
+else
+    echo "✗ Git branch function failed"
+fi
+
+# Test 4: Validate prompt colors
+echo "Test 4: Testing prompt color function..."
+if [[ -n "$(__prompt_color)" ]]; then
+    echo "✓ Prompt color function works"
+else
+    echo "✗ Prompt color function failed"
+fi
+
+echo "=== Tests complete ==="
+```
+
+## Visual Examples
+
+### Example Prompts
+
+#### In worktree, correct branch (GREEN)
+```
+[user@host worktree session/2025-10-16-test] [WORKTREE]$
+```
+
+#### In worktree, wrong branch (YELLOW)
+```
+[user@host worktree main] [WORKTREE]$
+```
+
+#### Outside worktree (RED)
+```
+[user@host repo main] [MAIN]$
+```
+
+## Agent Awareness Integration
+
+The enhanced prompt provides visual cues that agents should be trained to recognize:
+
+1. **Branch Verification**: Agents should check that the branch shown in the prompt matches the expected session branch
+2. **Worktree Status**: Agents should verify the `[WORKTREE]` indicator is present before performing session work
+3. **Color Coding**: Agents should be aware of color meanings and take corrective action when seeing yellow/red
+
+This will be detailed in the Agent Awareness Guidelines (Item 8).
+
+## Rollback Procedure
+
+To restore the original prompt:
+
+```bash
+# Call the restore function
+restore_prompt
+
+# Or manually
+export PS1="$ORIGINAL_PS1"
+```
+
+## Integration Points
+
+1. **Session Claiming**: The `claim-session` script should create the `.session-env` file with the enhanced prompt
+2. **Session Completion**: The `complete-session` script should restore the original prompt
+3. **Documentation**: Update `SESSIONS-README.md` to explain prompt indicators
+
+## Future Enhancements
+
+1. **Status Icons**: Add icons for different states (✓, ⚠, ✗)
+2. **Customization**: Allow users to configure prompt format
+3. **Additional Context**: Show number of uncommitted changes
+4. **Session Timer**: Display time elapsed in session

+# Temporary User with Restricted Permissions Investigation
+
+## Overview
+
+This document investigates the feasibility of creating a temporary, platform-agnostic (macOS, Linux, Windows) user with permissions restricted to only the worktree directory, and read-only access to other repository files, to prevent unauthorized edits.
+
+## Objective
+
+Create a user context that:
+1. Can only write to `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`
+2. Has read-only access to repository files
+3. Works across macOS, Linux, and Windows
+4. Can be created/destroyed automatically
+5. Integrates with session workflow
+
+## Platform Analysis
+
+### Linux
+
+#### User Creation
+```bash
+# Create temporary user
+sudo useradd -M -s /bin/bash session-user-{slug}
+
+# Set password (or use passwordless sudo)
+sudo passwd session-user-{slug}
+```
+
+#### Permission Control
+```bash
+# Grant read-only to repository
+sudo chmod -R u+r,g+r,o+r /path/to/repo
+
+# Grant write access to worktree only
+sudo chown -R session-user-{slug}:session-user-{slug} /path/to/repo/.worktrees/{slug}
+sudo chmod -R u+rwx /path/to/repo/.worktrees/{slug}
+
+# Use ACLs for finer control
+sudo setfacl -R -m u:session-user-{slug}:r /path/to/repo
+sudo setfacl -R -m u:session-user-{slug}:rwx /path/to/repo/.worktrees/{slug}
+```
+
+#### Cleanup
+```bash
+# Remove user when session ends
+sudo userdel session-user-{slug}
+```
+
+**Pros:**
+- Fine-grained permission control via ACLs
+- Well-established user management
+- Can use sudo for elevation
+
+**Cons:**
+- Requires sudo/root access
+- Complex permission management
+- May interfere with existing permissions
+
+### macOS
+
+#### User Creation
+```bash
+# Create user via dscl
+sudo dscl . -create /Users/session-user-{slug}
+sudo dscl . -create /Users/session-user-{slug} UserShell /bin/bash
+sudo dscl . -create /Users/session-user-{slug} UniqueID 5000
+sudo dscl . -create /Users/session-user-{slug} PrimaryGroupID 5000
+sudo dscl . -passwd /Users/session-user-{slug} password
+```
+
+#### Permission Control
+```bash
+# Similar to Linux, using chmod and chown
+sudo chmod -R +a "session-user-{slug} allow read" /path/to/repo
+sudo chmod -R +a "session-user-{slug} allow read,write,delete" /path/to/repo/.worktrees/{slug}
+```
+
+#### Cleanup
+```bash
+# Remove user
+sudo dscl . -delete /Users/session-user-{slug}
+```
+
+**Pros:**
+- Similar to Linux
+- Native ACL support
+
+**Cons:**
+- Requires admin privileges
+- More complex than Linux
+- Different syntax than Linux
+
+### Windows
+
+#### User Creation
+```powershell
+# Create local user
+net user session-user-{slug} /add
+
+# Or via PowerShell
+New-LocalUser -Name "session-user-{slug}" -NoPassword
+```
+
+#### Permission Control
+```powershell
+# Set read-only on repository
+icacls "C:\path\to\repo" /grant "session-user-{slug}:(R)"
+
+# Set read/write on worktree
+icacls "C:\path\to\repo\.worktrees\{slug}" /grant "session-user-{slug}:(OI)(CI)(F)"
+```
+
+#### Cleanup
+```powershell
+# Remove user
+net user session-user-{slug} /delete
+```
+
+**Pros:**
+- Native permission system
+- Granular access control
+
+**Cons:**
+- Requires administrator privileges
+- Very different from Unix systems
+- UAC complications
+
+## Cross-Platform Challenges
+
+### 1. Privilege Elevation
+
+**Problem:** Creating users requires root/admin access
+
+**Solutions:**
+- Pre-create users during system setup
+- Use containerization instead
+- Abandon user-based approach
+
+### 2. Permission Inheritance
+
+**Problem:** New files may not inherit correct permissions
+
+**Solutions:**
+- Set default ACLs on directories
+- Use umask to control defaults
+- Monitor and adjust permissions
+
+### 3. Process Execution
+
+**Problem:** Switching user context mid-session is complex
+
+**Solutions:**
+- Run entire session as temporary user
+- Use `su` (Linux/macOS) or `runas` (Windows)
+- Containerize the session
+
+### 4. Development Tool Integration
+
+**Problem:** VSCode, Git, etc. may not work well with user switching
+
+**Solutions:**
+- Configure tools for multi-user
+- Use SSH or remote contexts
+- Accept limitations
+
+## Alternative Approaches
+
+### Alternative 1: Docker/Container-Based Isolation
+
+Instead of OS users, use containers:
+
+```dockerfile
+# Session container
+FROM ubuntu:latest
+
+# Create non-root user
+RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash session-user
+
+# Copy repository (read-only)
+COPY --chown=root:root /repo /repo
+RUN chmod -R 444 /repo
+
+# Create writable worktree
+RUN mkdir -p /repo/.worktrees/{slug}
+RUN chown -R session-user:session-user /repo/.worktrees/{slug}
+
+USER session-user
+WORKDIR /repo/.worktrees/{slug}
+```
+
+**Pros:**
+- Perfect isolation
+- Cross-platform (via Docker)
+- Easy to create/destroy
+- No system-level permission changes
+
+**Cons:**
+- Requires Docker
+- Performance overhead
+- Complexity in setup
+- File sync challenges
+
+### Alternative 2: Virtual Environments with Restricted Paths
+
+Use language-specific virtual environments with path restrictions:
+
+```python
+# Python example
+import os
+import sys
+
+class RestrictedPath:
+    def __init__(self, allowed_path):
+        self.allowed = os.path.abspath(allowed_path)
+    
+    def validate(self, path):
+        abs_path = os.path.abspath(path)
+        if not abs_path.startswith(self.allowed):
+            raise PermissionError(f"Access denied: {path}")
+        return abs_path
+
+# Use in agent code
+worktree = RestrictedPath(".worktrees/session-slug")
+file_path = worktree.validate("some/file.txt")
+```
+
+**Pros:**
+- No system-level changes
+- Cross-platform
+- Programmatic control
+
+**Cons:**
+- Only works within application
+- Can be bypassed
+- Not OS-enforced
+
+### Alternative 3: Git Worktree + Read-Only Main Checkout
+
+Instead of user permissions, make main checkout read-only:
+
+```bash
+# Make main repository read-only
+chmod -R a-w .git
+chmod -R a-w * (except .worktrees)
+
+# Worktrees remain writable
+chmod -R u+w .worktrees/{slug}
+```
+
+**Pros:**
+- No user management
+- Simple to implement
+- Cross-platform
+
+**Cons:**
+- Can be easily changed back
+- Not secure against determined user
+- May interfere with Git operations
+
+## Feasibility Assessment
+
+### Technical Feasibility: ⚠️ MODERATE
+
+| Aspect | Feasibility | Notes |
+|--------|-------------|-------|
+| Linux | ✅ High | Well-supported, ACLs work well |
+| macOS | ⚠️ Medium | Possible but complex |
+| Windows | ⚠️ Medium | Very different implementation |
+| Cross-platform | ❌ Low | Would need 3 different implementations |
+| Automation | ⚠️ Medium | Requires elevated privileges |
+| Integration | ❌ Low | Complex with dev tools |
+
+### Practical Feasibility: ❌ LOW
+
+**Major Blockers:**
+
+1. **Privilege Requirements**
+   - Creating users requires root/admin
+   - Automating sudo/admin access is security risk
+   - May not have privileges in all environments
+
+2. **Tool Compatibility**
+   - VSCode may not handle user switching well
+   - Git operations may be disrupted
+   - SSH keys, credentials tied to original user
+
+3. **Workflow Disruption**
+   - Switching users mid-session is jarring
+   - Environment variables don't transfer
+   - Open files, terminals would be lost
+
+4. **Maintenance Complexity**
+   - Three separate implementations
+   - Permission debugging is difficult
+   - Cleanup on session failure
+
+## Recommended Approach
+
+### ❌ Do NOT Implement OS-Level User Restrictions
+
+**Reasons:**
+1. Too complex for the benefit
+2. Requires elevated privileges
+3. Platform-specific implementations
+4. Tool compatibility issues
+5. Workflow disruption
+
+### ✅ Alternative: Multi-Layered Soft Restrictions
+
+Instead, use a combination of:
+
+1. **Git Hooks** (already designed)
+   - Prevent commits outside worktree
+   - Block wrong branch operations
+
+2. **Shell Function Overrides** (already designed)
+   - Catch file operations
+   - Validate paths before execution
+
+3. **Environment-Based Restrictions** (already designed)
+   - Validate $SESSION_DIR
+   - Check prompt indicators
+
+4. **Agent Training** (already designed)
+   - Explicit guidelines
+   - Awareness of restrictions
+
+5. **Read-Only Main Checkout** (new)
+   - Simple file permissions
+   - No user management needed
+
+```bash
+# Simple read-only implementation
+make_repo_readonly() {
+    # Make everything except .worktrees read-only
+    find . -maxdepth 1 -not -name '.worktrees' -not -name '.' -exec chmod -R a-w {} \;
+    
+    # Keep .worktrees writable
+    chmod -R u+w .worktrees
+}
+
+make_repo_writable() {
+    # Restore write permissions
+    chmod -R u+w .
+}
+```
+
+## Docker-Based Isolation (Optional Advanced Feature)
+
+For users who want maximum isolation:
+
+### Session Container Template
+
+```dockerfile
+FROM ubuntu:22.04
+
+# Install dependencies
+RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y git
+
+# Create session user
+RUN useradd -m -s /bin/bash agent
+
+# Repository will be mounted as volume
+VOLUME /repo
+
+# Worktree will be writable
+VOLUME /repo/.worktrees
+
+USER agent
+WORKDIR /repo/.worktrees
+
+ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
+```
+
+### Usage
+
+```bash
+# Start session container
+docker run -it --rm \
+  -v /path/to/repo:/repo:ro \
+  -v /path/to/repo/.worktrees/{slug}:/repo/.worktrees/{slug}:rw \
+  session-container
+
+# Inside container, repository is read-only except worktree
+```
+
+**When to Use:**
+- High-security requirements
+- Untrusted code execution
+- Complete isolation needed
+- Docker already in use
+
+**When NOT to Use:**
+- Normal development workflow
+- Performance-critical operations
+- Simple personal projects
+
+## Implementation Recommendation
+
+### Phase 1: Implement Soft Restrictions (Priority)
+
+Focus on passive restraints already designed:
+1. Git hooks
+2. Shell overrides
+3. Environment variables
+4. Agent guidelines
+5. File system guardrails
+
+### Phase 2: Optional Read-Only Enhancement
+
+Add simple file permission restrictions:
+1. Make main checkout read-only
+2. Keep worktrees writable
+3. Provide toggle commands
+
+### Phase 3: Optional Docker Support
+
+For advanced users:
+1. Create session container template
+2. Document Docker workflow
+3. Provide convenience scripts
+
+## Conclusion
+
+Creating temporary OS-level users with restricted permissions is:
+
+- **Technically possible** but with significant platform-specific complexity
+- **Practically infeasible** due to privilege requirements and tool compatibility
+- **Not recommended** for the Agent Sessions Protocol
+
+Instead, the multi-layered approach of passive restraints (hooks, overrides, validation) provides sufficient protection without the complexity and limitations of user-based isolation.
+
+For cases requiring maximum isolation, Docker containers are a better solution than temporary users.
+
+## Decision
+
+**Do NOT pursue temporary user creation.**
+
+**Rationale:**
+1. Complexity far exceeds benefit
+2. Requires privileges we can't assume
+3. Breaks development workflows
+4. Platform-specific nightmares
+5. Soft restrictions are sufficient
+
+**Action:**
+Proceed with designed passive restraints and consider Docker as optional advanced feature for users who need it.

Subject: [PATCH 08/18] [2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol] fix: remove
 remaining worktree references from SESSIONS-README

- Update all remaining .worktrees/ references to .sessions/
- Fix manual process examples to use shallow clones instead of worktrees
- Update directory structure documentation
- Correct session activation paths for new architecture

Shallow clones should live in .sessions/ directory as independent repository
clones, providing complete isolation while maintaining simple Git workflow.

Subject: [PATCH 09/18] [2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol] refactor:
 comprehensive SESSIONS-README cleanup and restructure

- Remove ALL remaining .worktrees references and replace with .sessions/
- Move sessions.lock to _AGENTS/sessions/ directory for proper organization
- Replace literal shell scripts with natural language procedures
- Consolidate redundant sections (Session Activation & Claiming removed)
- Restructure Git Workflow SOP with proper lifecycle phases:
  * Session Initialization & Claiming
  * Ongoing Work
  * Session Completion & Abandonment
- Update all directory structures to reflect hub-spoke architecture
- Fix session activation paths and environment sourcing
- Update best practices to use .sessions/ instead of .worktrees/
- Remove emergency shell script examples, reference documentation instead

This completes the documentation transition to hub-spoke architecture with
no remaining worktree references anywhere in the protocol documentation.

Subject: [PATCH 10/18] [2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol] fix: correct
 manual process description in SESSIONS-README

- Fix manual process to describe actual manual steps without invoking scripts
- Clarify that scripts automate the manual procedures, not replace them
- Update manual process steps to be descriptive rather than prescriptive
- Maintain clear separation between manual procedure description and automation

This ensures the manual process section truly describes the underlying steps
that the utility scripts automate, rather than just referencing the scripts
themselves.

Subject: [PATCH 11/18] [2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol] fix: remove
 redundant 'Session Activation & Claiming' section

Final cleanup to complete worktree removal:
- Remove entire 'Session Activation & Claiming' section (lines 187-212) that contained outdated worktree instructions
- Update best practices to use correct '{session-slug}/.codebase/' instead of '.worktrees/{session-slug}/'

This eliminates all remaining worktree references from SESSIONS-README.md, ensuring the documentation now completely reflects the hub-spoke architecture with session clones living as .codebase/ subdirectories within session directories.

 - **Answer:** Use `worklog.md` for progress updates, `active-plan.md` for task changes, and `subsessions.md` for scope additions that create new sessions. These files are writable during active work.
 
-### Session Activation & Claiming
-
-Agent identity is established per-session via environment variables. The `claim-session` script creates a `.session-env` file in the session directory.
-
-**Claim Process:**
-
-1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
-2. Check `.agents/sessions.lock` for availability
-3. Add claim: `echo "{session-slug}:$(date +%s)" >> .agents/sessions.lock`
-4. Commit and push: `git commit -m "[2025-10-14-feature-x] Claim session" && git push`
-5. If push fails (race condition), pick different session
-6. Move session to `active/{session-slug}/` and commit
-7. Create `.session-env` file in session directory and commit
-8. Create worktree with session branch: `git worktree add -b session/{slug} .worktrees/{slug}`
-9. Activate session in worktree: `source ../../sessions/active/{slug}/.session-env`
-
-**Activation:**
-
-```bash
-cd .worktrees/{session-slug}
-source ../../sessions/active/{session-slug}/.session-env
-```
-
-Session activation sets git identity and environment for that session only. The `.session-env` file contains all environment variables for this session's agent identity.
-

+### Session Lifecycle Overview
+
+The Git workflow follows three distinct phases: **Session Initialization**, **Ongoing Work**, and **Session Completion/Cancellation**. Each phase uses standard Git operations within the isolated session clone.
+
+### 1. Session Initialization & Claiming
+
+**Automated via:** `_AGENTS/sessions/_bin/claim-session {session-slug}`
+
+**Manual procedure:**
+1. Update main repository from remote
+2. Check session availability in `_AGENTS/sessions/sessions.lock`
+3. Atomically claim session via git push to lock file
+4. Move session from `planned/` to `active/` with read-only SESSION.md protection
+5. Create session environment file (`.session-env`) with agent identity variables
+6. Create shallow clone in `active/{session-slug}/.codebase/` from main repository
+7. Create session-specific branch within clone and configure remote as upstream
+8. Provide activation instructions for working in the session
+
+### 2. Ongoing Work
+
+**Working Environment:**
+- Primary workspace: `_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/.codebase/` (shallow clone)
+- Session metadata: `_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/` (environment, tracking files)
+- Remote configuration: `origin` renamed to `upstream` (points to main repo)
+
+**Branch Strategy:**
+- Session works on `session/{session-slug}` branch within session clone
+- Main repository remains on base branch (e.g., `main`)
+- Session branch is isolated from other sessions
+- Periodic pushes to main repository for backup
+
+**Commit Strategy:**
+- All commits automatically attributed via session environment variables
+- Code changes committed with session-prefixed messages
+- Session metadata updated in main repository separately from code changes
+- Knowledge capture in session-scoped directories
+- Always use specific file paths rather than `git add .`
+
+**File Management:**
+- Code changes: Made within `{session-slug}/.codebase/`, committed to session branch
+- Session metadata: Updated in `{session-slug}/` directory, committed to main branch
+- Knowledge artifacts: Created in `_AGENTS/knowledge/sessions/{session}/`
+
+### 3. Session Completion
+
+**Automated via:** `_AGENTS/sessions/_bin/complete-session {session-slug}`
+
+**Manual procedure:**
+1. Generate patch file from session work in `.codebase/`
+2. Check for KB learnings and create merge session if needed
+3. Remove session clone directory (`.codebase/`)
+4. Merge session branch to main via squash merge
+5. Remove session entry from `_AGENTS/sessions/sessions.lock`
+6. Move session from `active/` to `completed/`
+7. Delete session branch and clean up
+8. Provide instructions for environment deactivation
+
+**Post-Completion:**
+- Session remains read-only in `completed/` for audit purposes
+- Patch file available for review
+- KB merge sessions created automatically when learnings exist
+- Environment variables should be unset
+
+### 4. Session Cancellation
+
+**Automated via:** `_AGENTS/sessions/_bin/cancel-session {session-slug}` (to be implemented)
+
+**Manual procedure:**
+1. Document cancellation reasons in session `worklog.md`
+2. Remove session clone directory (`.codebase/`)
+3. Remove session entry from `_AGENTS/sessions/sessions.lock`
+4. Move session from `active/` to `abandoned/`
+5. Create abandonment commit with clear documentation
+6. Optionally create KB merge session for partial learnings
+7. Clean up session branch if created
+
+**Post-Cancellation:**
+- Session moved to `abandoned/` with documented reasons
+- Partial work available for future reference
+- Lock file updated to free session slot
+
+### Branch and Merge Strategy
+
+**Session Branches:**
+- Format: `session/{session-slug}`
+- Created during session initialization within session clone
+- Used exclusively within session's `.codebase/` directory
+- Merged to main via squash merge during completion
+- Deleted after successful completion or cancellation
+
+**Main Repository Integration:**
+- Main repository receives squash merges from completed sessions
+- Clean history maintained with single commit per session
+- Session contributions clearly attributed via commit messages
+- Conflict resolution documented in session worklog when needed

Subject: [PATCH 12/18] [2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol] feat:
 implement local .gitignore for session management

Implement local .gitignore strategy for hub-spoke architecture:

- Create _AGENTS/sessions/.gitignore with session-specific ignore patterns
- Remove old .worktrees/ reference from root .gitignore
- Update SESSIONS-README.md to document local .gitignore approach
- Add comprehensive ignore patterns for session clones, temp files, build artifacts

Key benefits:
- Local to sessions directory - keeps session rules separate from main project
- Version controlled - shared across all developers and agents
- Overrides project-level patterns - more specific than root .gitignore
- Ignores */.codebase/ directories (session clones) automatically

Tested and verified that local .gitignore works correctly - session clones are properly ignored.

+# Agent Sessions Protocol - Quick Reference
+
+> **📖 For detailed examples and troubleshooting:** See [SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md](../knowledge/llm-coding-agent-patterns/SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md)
+
+## Quick Start Commands
+
+```bash
+# Claim and activate session
+./_bin/claim-session 2025-10-14-feature-x
+
+# Activate session environment (in session codebase)
+cd _AGENTS/sessions/active/2025-10-14-feature-x/.codebase
+source ../.session-env
+
+# Complete session (unlocks SESSION.md for final updates)
+cd ../../../../..
+./_bin/complete-session 2025-10-14-feature-x
+```
+
+## Essential Rules
+
+### 1. Session States
+- **drafting/** - Being defined, not ready
+- **planned/** - Ready to claim
+- **active/** - Currently being worked on
+- **completed/** - Successfully finished
+- **abandoned/** - Cancelled/incomplete
+
+### 2. File Permissions
+- **SESSION.md is READ-ONLY** during active sessions (chmod 444)
+- Use **worklog.md** for progress updates
+- Use **active-plan.md** for task changes
+- Use **subsessions.md** for scope additions
+
+### 3. Session Naming
+- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug`
+- Examples: `2025-10-14-auth-system`, `2025-10-14-api-refactor`
+- KB merge sessions: `kb-YYYY-MM-DD-merge-topic`
+
+### 4. Git Branch Naming
+- Format: `session/{session-id}`
+- Examples: `session/2025-10-14-auth-system`
+
+### 5. Commit Message Format
+- Format: `[{session-id}] <type>: <description>`
+- Examples: `[2025-10-14-auth-system] feat: add user authentication`
+
+### 6. Knowledge Base Rules
+- **Read KB**: Anytime from `knowledge/`
+- **Write Learnings**: During work to `knowledge/sessions/{session}/`
+- **Merge to Canonical**: Only via KB merge sessions to `knowledge/`
+
+### 7. Multi-Agent Coordination
+- **Always pull before claiming** sessions
+- **Handle race conditions gracefully** - pick different session if claim fails
+- **Namespace everything** - use `{session-slug}/.codebase/`
+- **Session-prefixed commits** - every commit tagged with `[{session-id}]`
+- **Coordinate via git** - no external tools needed
+
+### 8. Environment Variables (Set automatically)
+- `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` - Agent-specific git author
+- `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` - Agent-specific git email  
+- `SESSION_SLUG` - Session identifier
+- `SESSION_BRANCH` - Session branch name
+
+### 9. Critical Directories
+- **Main workspace**: `_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/.codebase/`
+- **Session metadata**: `_AGENTS/sessions/active/{session-slug}/`
+- **Session lock**: `.agents/sessions.lock`
+
+### 10. Emergency Override
+- Only use in critical situations
+- Document reason in worklog.md first
+- Use: `chmod 644 sessions/active/{session}/SESSION.md`
+- Always restore read-only after: `chmod 444 sessions/active/{session}/SESSION.md`
+
+## Verification Checklist
+- [ ] Session claimed successfully
+- [ ] Environment variables set (`echo $GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`)
+- [ ] Working in correct directory (`.codebase/`)
+- [ ] Using session-prefixed commits
+- [ ] Updating worklog.md regularly
+- [ ] Capturing learnings in `knowledge/sessions/{session}/`
+- [ ] SESSION.md remains read-only during work
+
+## Common Issues
+- **Claim fails**: Another agent got it first, try different session
+- **Can't edit SESSION.md**: Expected behavior, use worklog.md instead
+- **Wrong git author**: Check environment variables are sourced
+- **Merge conflicts**: Document resolution in worklog.md

+# Best Practices for AI Agent Rules Files
+
+This document outlines best practices for creating and managing rules files for AI coding agents, drawing insights from various sources and industry trends. The goal is to ensure clear communication, consistency, and effective guidance for AI agents in software development workflows.
+
+## 1. Standardization and Format
+
+*   **Embrace Standardization**: There is a growing movement towards standardized rules files, such as `AGENTS.md`, to consolidate agent-specific configurations (e.g., `.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`, `.junie/guidelines.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`). This reduces fragmentation and promotes interoperability across different AI tools.
+*   **Use Markdown with Configuration**: Many tools support Markdown files, often enhanced with YAML frontmatter or XML-like tags (e.g., `.mdc` format) for structured rules. This allows for human-readable content alongside machine-interpretable configurations.
+
+## 2. Scope and Granularity
+
+*   **Keep Rules Small and Scoped**: Avoid monolithic rules files. Instead, keep individual rules files focused on specific concerns or contexts.
+*   **Implement Hierarchical Rules**: For large repositories, use a hierarchical structure. Place a general `AGENTS.md` in the repository root for global guidelines, and more specific rules files (e.g., `AGENTS.md` or `.clinerules/`) in subdirectories to provide context-aware guidance relevant to that specific part of the codebase.
+*   **Distinguish Project-Specific vs. Global Rules**: Clearly separate rules that apply to a specific project from those that are global (e.g., user-specific configurations in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`).
+
+## 3. Content and Clarity
+
+*   **Provide Clear and Detailed Instructions**: Agents need explicit guidance. Use precise language, concrete examples, and specific file paths.
+*   **Define Action Objectives**: Clearly state the objectives for actions the agent should take. Minimize complexity and keep actions simple.
+*   **Specify Coding Standards**: Include rules for:
+    *   **Style and Formatting**: Enforce consistent style, naming conventions, and code structure.
+    *   **Best Practices vs. Anti-patterns**: Document both recommended practices and patterns to avoid.
+    *   **Quality Assurance**: Mandate testing, continuous integration (CI), performance considerations, and security best practices.
+    *   **Error Handling**: Define how errors should be caught and logged.
+    *   **Commit Hygiene**: Specify commit message formats (e.g., Conventional Commits).
+*   **Avoid Conflicts and Duplication**: Ensure that rules are consistent and do not contradict each other. Avoid redundant information across different rules files or knowledge documents.
+*   **Add Contextual Information**: Provide additional system instructions or context that the agent might not infer from the user's prompt (e.g., user type, timestamp, specific domain knowledge).
+
+## 4. Agent Interaction and Safety
+
+*   **Treat Prompts as a Roadmap**: Guide the agent with a clear roadmap rather than just demanding an outcome. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
+*   **Specify Limitations and Constraints**: Clearly define what the agent should and should not do. This includes limiting output length, avoiding certain punctuation, or requiring human validation for sensitive topics.
+*   **Consider Data Security**: Limit the agent's access to only the data it needs to perform its job. Avoid exposing it to sensitive or non-essential information.
+*   **Iterate and Test**: Leverage the agent's ability to iterate on code through testing. Have it write tests, run them, and verify functionality.
+*   **Verify Understanding**: Start by using the agent in a "question-answering" mode to confirm its understanding of the codebase before allowing it to make modifications.
+*   **Guardrails**: Implement layered guardrails, including LLM-based and rules-based (e.g., regex) guardrails, to create more resilient agents.
+
+## 5. Maintenance and Evolution
+
+*   **Iterate and Refine**: Continuously improve rules by adding new ones when recurring mistakes are observed.
+*   **Regular Review and Updates**: Periodically review and update rules and knowledge documents to ensure they remain relevant and accurate as the project or technology evolves.
+
+By adhering to these best practices, developers can create more effective, reliable, and maintainable AI agent rules files, ultimately enhancing the productivity and quality of AI-assisted development.

Subject: [PATCH 16/18] Align session protocol documentation with authoritative
 README-FOR-USERS.md

- Updated README-FOR-AGENTS.md manual steps to match authoritative protocol
- Updated SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md to reflect shallow clone architecture instead of worktree approach
- Fixed all working directory paths and activation examples
- Ensured consistency across all session protocol documentation
- Maintained hub-spoke architecture with shallow clones as specified in README-FOR-USERS.md

 **Benefits:**
-- Shared `.git` directory (efficient disk usage)
+- Shallow clones (efficient disk usage)
 - Isolated working directories (no file conflicts)
 - Can run multiple sessions concurrently
 - Main repo stays on base branch (dev/main)
 - Session metadata separate from workspace
 
 **Limitations:**
-- Can't checkout same branch in multiple worktrees
 - Each session must have unique branch name
-- `.worktrees/` directory should be in `.gitignore`
+- `.codebase/` directories are ignored via local .gitignore
