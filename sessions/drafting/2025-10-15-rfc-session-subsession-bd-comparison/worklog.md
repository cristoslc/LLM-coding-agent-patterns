# Session Worklog: RFC Session/Subsession Process vs BD Integration

## [2025-10-15 10:00] RFC Creation Started

**Context:** User requested RFC comparing current session process with BD integration using markdown task list format.

**Actions Taken:**
- Created `_templates/rfc.md.j2` template for RFC documents
- Established session folder structure for RFC development
- Drafted comprehensive comparison between session workflow and BDD methodology

**Key Decisions:**
- BD interpreted as "Behavior Driven Development" based on context
- RFC structured with comparison table and implementation phases
- Maintained backward compatibility as core principle

## [2025-10-15 10:15] Template and Structure Setup

**Created:** RFC template with standard sections for systematic documentation
**Established:** Session folder following YYYY-MM-DD naming convention
**Documented:** Current session process vs BDD integration in structured comparison

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Refinement** - Present RFC for stakeholder feedback
2. **Technical Validation** - Assess BDD tooling integration feasibility
3. **Pilot Implementation** - Test BD integration with sample sessions
4. **Documentation Updates** - Update session protocols if BD integration approved
