# Session: Align Sessions Protocol Files

## Context

The sessions protocol has undergone significant refactoring to be session-focused rather than agent-focused. All `{agent-id}` references have been eradicated, and the workflow has been improved with KB merge sessions starting in `drafting/` status. However, there may be inconsistencies, missing documentation, unclear instructions, or opportunities for simplification across all session-related files.

This session conducts a comprehensive review and alignment of:
- **Documentation**: `SESSIONS-README.md`, `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md`
- **Scripts**: `_bin/claim-session`, `_bin/complete-session`
- **Templates**: `_templates/kb-merge-SESSION.md`, `_templates/session-env.template`
- **Supporting files**: Any other files in `_AGENTS/sessions/`

## Acceptance Criteria

## Original Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Inventory & Assessment (1 hour)

1. **Read all files thoroughly**
   - `SESSIONS-README.md` - Essential protocol
   - `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md` - Detailed implementation
   - `_bin/claim-session` - Session claiming script
   - `_bin/complete-session` - Session completion script
   - `_templates/kb-merge-SESSION.md` - KB merge template
   - `_templates/session-env.template` - Environment template
   - Any other files in `_AGENTS/sessions/`

2. **Create alignment checklist**
   - Document all inconsistencies found
   - Note missing documentation
   - Identify unclear sections
   - Mark opportunities for simplification
   - Track environment variable usage
   - Track branch naming conventions
   - Track commit message formats

3. **Prioritize issues**
   - Critical: Incorrect or contradictory information
   - High: Missing essential documentation
   - Medium: Unclear or confusing sections
   - Low: Simplification opportunities

### Phase 2: Documentation Review & Fixes (2 hours)

1. **SESSIONS-README.md review**
   - Verify all examples are current

   - Validate all examples work
   - Review troubleshooting section
   - Check audit queries work
   - Verify flowcharts are accurate
   - Review conflict resolution examples

3. **Cross-reference validation**
   - All README → REFERENCE links work
   - All REFERENCE → README links work
   - Concepts explained in README are detailed in REFERENCE
   - No contradictions between files

### Phase 3: Script & Template Review (1 hour)

1. **Script validation**
   - Scripts match documented behavior
   - Error messages are helpful
   - Edge cases are handled
   - Comments are accurate
   - Usage examples are correct

2. **Template validation**
   - Templates match script output
   - All variables are documented
   - Templates are clear and helpful
   - No outdated content

3. **Integration testing**
   - Verify script output matches templates
   - Verify templates work with documented workflow
   - Check environment file generation

### Phase 4: Content Creation & Enhancement (1 hour)

1. **Create missing documentation**
   - Add any missing workflow examples
   - Document undocumented edge cases
   - Add troubleshooting for common issues
   - Enhance quick start if needed

2. **Add helpful content**
   - Common patterns documentation
   - Best practices for sessions
   - Tips and tricks section
   - FAQ if needed

3. **Create missing files**
   - Additional templates if needed
   - Helper scripts if beneficial
   - Documentation files if helpful

### Phase 5: Simplification & Polish (1 hour)

1. **Simplify complex sections**
   - Break down dense paragraphs
   - Add more examples where helpful
   - Use bullet points and lists
   - Improve headings and structure

2. **Remove redundancy**
   - Consolidate duplicate information
   - Remove outdated content
   - Streamline verbose explanations
   - Merge related sections

3. **Improve readability**

   - Check all acceptance criteria
   - Verify no broken references
   - Ensure consistency throughout

2. **Update worklog**
   - Document all changes made
   - Note any issues found
   - Capture learnings
   - Document decisions

3. **Create patch and complete**
   - Generate session patch
   - Update session artifacts
   - Prepare for completion

## Notes

### Key Focus Areas

1. **Session-Focused Language**: Ensure all documentation and code focuses on sessions, not agents
2. **Consistency**: Branch naming, commit messages, environment variables must be consistent
3. **Clarity**: New users should be able to follow the protocol without confusion
4. **Completeness**: All workflows should be documented end-to-end
5. **Accuracy**: Documentation must match actual implementation

### Expected Outcomes

- All session protocol files are aligned and consistent
- Documentation is clear, accurate, and complete
- Scripts match documented behavior perfectly
- Templates work seamlessly with scripts
- New users can easily understand and follow the protocol
- No contradictory or outdated information remains

### Potential Challenges

- Finding subtle inconsistencies across multiple files
- Balancing completeness with conciseness
- Ensuring examples remain realistic and helpful
- Maintaining backward compatibility if needed
- Deciding what content to remove vs. improve
