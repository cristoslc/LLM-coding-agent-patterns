# Worklog: Test Worktree Workflow

## [2025-10-15] Session Created

Created testing session to validate the new worktree-based workflow end-to-end.

**Priority:** CRITICAL - This must work before other agents can use the system.

**Scope:**
- Test claim-session script in real scenario
- Test worktree environment and isolation
- Test complete-session script
- Validate all documentation examples
- Fix any bugs found immediately
- Document all findings

**Context:**
Session `2025-10-15-align-sessions-protocol` implemented the worktree workflow but never tested it. This session validates that everything works correctly.

**Session Status:** Drafting - ready for review and move to planned/
