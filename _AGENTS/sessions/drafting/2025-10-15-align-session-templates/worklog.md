# Worklog: Align Session Templates

## [2025-10-15] Session Created

Created session to update template files to match the new worktree-based workflow.

**Priority:** Medium - Templates need updating but not blocking.

**Scope:**
- Review both template files in _templates/
- Update session-env.template to match claim-session script
- Update kb-merge-SESSION.md to match complete-session script
- Ensure all variables are correct and current
- Remove outdated references and language
- Test that scripts generate correct output from templates

**Context:**
During session `2025-10-15-align-sessions-protocol`, the scripts were updated but templates were never reviewed. This session closes that gap.

**Why This Matters:**
Templates are used by scripts to generate session files. If templates are outdated, generated files will be incorrect, causing confusion and errors.

**Session Status:** Drafting - ready for review and move to planned/
