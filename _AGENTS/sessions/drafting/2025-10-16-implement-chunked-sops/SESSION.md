# Session: Implement Chunked SOPs for LLM Agents

## Session Slug: `2025-10-16-implement-chunked-sops`

## Phase: Drafting

## Status: Pinned (Do Not Start Yet)

## Objective

Implement the recommendations from the `sop-research-findings.md` to create and integrate chunked, structured Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for LLM agents within the Agent Sessions Protocol. This will enhance LLM comprehension, accuracy, and adherence to procedural guidelines.

## Research Phase (Initial Thoughts - To be expanded)

The research phase for this session will focus on exploring and evaluating multiple strategies for implementing chunked SOPs. This includes:

*   **Chunking Libraries/Tools**: Investigate existing NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) and specialized chunking tools for their effectiveness in segmenting procedural text.
*   **Semantic Chunking Implementations**: Research methods for implementing LLM-assisted or embedding-based semantic chunking to ensure logical coherence.
*   **Structured Data Formats**: Evaluate different structured data formats (e.g., JSON, YAML, custom markdown structures) for representing SOPs as decision trees or DAGs that are easily parsable by LLMs.
*   **Integration with Agent Workflow**: Explore how to best integrate the chunked and structured SOPs into the existing agent workflow, including how agents will retrieve and interpret relevant chunks at each step.
*   **Poka-Yoke Mechanism Integration**: Research how to effectively embed the enhanced poka-yoke mechanisms (branch protection, directory validation, etc.) directly into the SOPs and agent execution environment.
*   **Passive Restraint Implementation**: Investigate best practices for creating and integrating `.roo/rules` or similar passive restraint files to enforce protocol adherence.

## Implementation Plan (To be detailed)

This section will be detailed once the research phase is complete and a preferred strategy is identified. It will outline the steps for:

1.  Creating the `.roo/rules` file.
2.  Developing templates or tools for generating chunked and structured SOPs.
3.  Modifying existing session scripts (`claim-session`, `complete-session`) to incorporate SOP validation and error-proofing.
4.  Implementing new agent behaviors for interacting with chunked SOPs.
5.  Testing and validating the new system.

## Dependencies

*   Completion of `2025-10-16-investigate-worktree-protocol` session and finalization of `sop-research-findings.md`.

## Notes

This session is currently in the drafting phase and should not be started until explicitly instructed. The primary goal of this draft is to capture the intent and initial research directions.
