# Session: Fix Session Scripts

## Context
The claim-session and complete-session scripts are critical utilities for the Agent Sessions Protocol, but they currently have several reliability and consistency issues that need to be addressed. These scripts handle the atomic claiming and completion of sessions, which are fundamental operations for multi-agent coordination. However, they lack proper error handling, validation, and consistency in their approach to file operations and git commands.

This session will systematically improve both scripts to handle edge cases, ensure consistency, and provide robust error handling while maintaining the protocol's requirements for atomic operations and traceability.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation of the session management scripts has the following critical issues:

**Claim-Session Script Issues:**
- Assumes `.agents/sessions.lock` file exists and is writable without validation
- Doesn't handle cases where SESSION.md file doesn't exist in the planned session
- Doesn't validate that the session branch doesn't already exist before creation
- Doesn't check if the session clone directory already exists before attempting to create it
- Lacks proper error handling for git operations (shallow clone creation, branch operations)
- No validation of session name format or existence

**Complete-Session Script Issues:**
- Assumes `.agents/sessions.lock` file exists and is writable without validation
- Doesn't handle cases where SESSION.md file doesn't exist in the active session
- Doesn't validate that the session branch exists before attempting operations
- Doesn't handle cases where the session clone directory doesn't exist
- Doesn't handle cases where KB merge session template file doesn't exist
- Lacks proper cleanup handling if operations fail partway through
- No rollback mechanisms for failed operations

**Consistency Issues:**
- Different approaches to handle file permissions and error states
- Inconsistent error handling patterns (some operations fail silently, others exit)
- Inconsistent user feedback (some operations provide detailed output, others are silent)
- Mixed approaches to validation and pre-flight checks

**Edge Cases Not Handled:**
- Git repository not in clean state when claiming/completing sessions
- User doesn't have write permissions to required files/directories
- Git remote not accessible during operations
- Session directory structure is corrupted or incomplete
- Concurrent access to session files (race conditions)
- Disk space issues during session clone creation
- Network connectivity issues during git operations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Error Handling for File Operations**: All file operations (read, write, create, delete, chmod) must have proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- [ ] **Git Operation Validation**: All git operations must validate preconditions (repository state, branch existence, worktree status) before execution
- [ ] **Consistency in Error Handling**: Both scripts must use consistent error handling patterns (exit codes, error messages, cleanup behavior)
- [ ] **User Feedback Consistency**: Both scripts must provide consistent, informative feedback for all operations (success, warning, error states)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Both scripts must have comprehensive documentation including usage examples, error conditions, and troubleshooting guidance
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: Both scripts must have test suites covering normal operations, edge cases, and error conditions
- [ ] **Edge Case Verification**: Both scripts must handle all identified edge cases gracefully without leaving the system in an inconsistent state

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design (Day 1)
1. **Comprehensive Script Review**: Analyze both scripts line-by-line to identify all potential failure points
2. **Edge Case Documentation**: Create comprehensive list of all edge cases and failure scenarios
3. **Error Handling Strategy**: Define consistent error handling patterns and exit codes
4. **Validation Framework**: Design validation functions for common operations (file existence, git state, permissions)

### Phase 2: Core Improvements (Days 2-3)
5. **Add Error Handling for File Operations**: Implement robust error handling for all file operations with proper cleanup
6. **Add Git Operation Validation**: Implement pre-flight checks for all git operations
7. **Implement Consistent Error Handling**: Refactor both scripts to use consistent error handling patterns
8. **Improve User Feedback**: Standardize user feedback across both scripts with clear status messages

### Phase 3: Documentation and Testing (Days 4-5)
9. **Add Comprehensive Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for both scripts including examples and troubleshooting
10. **Create Test Suites**: Develop comprehensive test suites covering normal and edge case scenarios
11. **Integration Testing**: Test both scripts in various repository states and configurations
12. **Performance Validation**: Ensure improvements don't negatively impact script performance

### Phase 4: Final Validation (Day 6)
13. **Edge Case Verification**: Systematically test all identified edge cases
14. **Cross-platform Testing**: Verify scripts work correctly on different operating systems
15. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all documentation is accurate and complete
16. **Create KB Merge Session**: Document learnings and create KB merge session if significant knowledge is captured

## Success Metrics
- **Zero unhandled errors**: All file and git operations have proper error handling
- **Consistent user experience**: Both scripts provide uniform feedback and error handling
- **Comprehensive test coverage**: Test suite covers >90% of code paths including all edge cases
- **Improved reliability**: Scripts handle all identified edge cases without system corruption
- **Better documentation**: Complete documentation enables easy maintenance and troubleshooting

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Changes might break existing session workflows
  - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing with backup/rollback procedures
- **Risk**: Error handling might make scripts slower
  - **Mitigation**: Performance testing and optimization of critical paths
- **Risk**: Complex error handling might make code harder to maintain
  - **Mitigation**: Clear documentation and modular error handling functions

## Dependencies
- Access to test repositories for validation
- Understanding of current session protocol requirements
- Knowledge of git shallow clone and branch management
- Familiarity with shell scripting best practices

## Updated Implementation Plan
1. Review both scripts to identify all potential edge cases in shallow clone architecture
2. Add error handling for all file operations
3. Add validation for all git operations (clone, branch, merge)
4. Ensure consistency in error handling and user feedback
5. Add documentation for both scripts with shallow clone examples
6. Add tests for both scripts covering shallow clone scenarios
7. Verify that both scripts work correctly in all edge cases
8. Create KB merge session if needed
