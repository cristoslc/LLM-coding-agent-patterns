## [2025-10-15 15:03] Session Created

Created new session for fixing claim-session and complete-session scripts.

## [2025-10-15 15:03] Initial Analysis

Analyzed both scripts and identified the following issues:
- Claim-Session Script Issues:
  - Assumes .agents/sessions.lock file exists and is writable
  - Doesn't handle case where SESSION.md file doesn't exist
  - Doesn't validate session branch doesn't already exist
  - Doesn't check if worktree directory already exists

- Complete-Session Script Issues:
  - Assumes .agents/sessions.lock file exists and is writable
  - Doesn't handle case where SESSION.md file doesn't exist
  - Doesn't validate session branch exists
  - Doesn't handle case where worktree directory doesn't exist
  - Doesn't handle case where KB merge session template file doesn't exist

- Consistency Issues:
  - Different approaches to handle file permissions
  - Inconsistent error handling
  - Inconsistent user feedback

- Edge Cases:
  - Git repository not in clean state
  - User doesn't have write permissions
  - Git remote not accessible

## [2025-10-15 15:03] Next Steps

1. Add error handling for all file operations
2. Add validation for all git operations
3. Ensure consistency in error handling and user feedback
4. Add documentation for both scripts
5. Add tests for both scripts
6. Verify that both scripts work correctly in all edge cases

## [2025-10-15 15:42] SESSION.md Enhanced and Committed

Enhanced the SESSION.md file to address protocol compliance feedback:
- Expanded context section with comprehensive problem analysis
- Added detailed categorization of issues (20+ specific problems identified)
- Enhanced acceptance criteria with measurable success conditions
- Created detailed 4-phase implementation plan with timeline and deliverables
- Added success metrics, risks, and mitigation strategies
- Included comprehensive edge case analysis and dependencies
- Committed changes with proper session-prefixed commit message
- Pushed to remote repository (dev branch)

The session now fully conforms to the Agent Sessions Protocol with a comprehensive, actionable session definition ready for implementation.
