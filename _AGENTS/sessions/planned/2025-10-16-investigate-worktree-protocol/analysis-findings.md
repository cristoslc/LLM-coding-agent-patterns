# Worktree Protocol Investigation: Findings and Analysis

## Current Protocol Documentation Analysis

### What the Documentation Actually Says

After reviewing both SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md, the worktree protocol is actually **very clearly documented**:

#### From SESSIONS-README.md (Lines 107-117):
```bash
# 4. Create worktree with session branch (outside sessions/)
git worktree add -b session/2025-10-14-feature-x \
  .worktrees/2025-10-14-feature-x \
  HEAD

# 5. Activate session and start work
cd .worktrees/2025-10-14-feature-x
source ../../sessions/active/2025-10-14-feature-x/.session-env

# Now working in isolated worktree!
```

#### From SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md (Lines 434-476):
**Section: "Git Worktrees Setup"** - Dedicated 3-page section explaining:
- How worktrees work
- Creating session worktrees
- Multiple concurrent sessions
- Cleanup procedures
- Benefits and limitations

#### From SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md (Lines 264-270):
```bash
# Activate session environment (in worktree)
cd .worktrees/2025-10-14-auth-system
source ../../sessions/active/2025-10-14-auth-system/.session-env
```

### Key Protocol Points That Were Violated

1. **Worktree Creation Timing**: Protocol clearly states worktree should be created **immediately after claiming** (Line 108 in README, Line 45 in REFERENCE)

2. **Working Directory Requirement**: Protocol explicitly states to **"cd .worktrees/{session-slug}"** before activating session environment

3. **Isolation Principle**: Documentation emphasizes worktrees provide "isolated working directories" and "namespace isolation"

4. **Concurrent Session Support**: Protocol designed for "multiple sessions work concurrently" using worktrees

## Root Cause Analysis: Why Protocol Was Violated

### Primary Issue: **Agent Decision-Making Failure**
The protocol documentation is **crystal clear** - the failure was in **execution/decision-making**, not documentation clarity.

### Specific Decision Points Where Protocol Failed:

1. **Session Start Decision Point**:
   - **Should have**: Created worktree immediately when session started
   - **Actually did**: Worked in main directory, never created worktree initially

2. **File Creation Decision Points**:
   - **Should have**: Created all session files within worktree directory
   - **Actually did**: Created files scattered across repository root

3. **Working Directory Decision Points**:
   - **Should have**: Changed to worktree directory before any work
   - **Actually did**: Stayed in main repository directory

4. **Session Environment Activation**:
   - **Should have**: Activated session environment from within worktree
   - **Actually did**: Attempted to source environment from wrong location

## Contributing Factors

### 1. **PWD Anchoring Loss**
- Agent lost track of current working directory
- No validation of current directory before operations
- No checks to ensure working in correct location

### 2. **Missing Validation Steps**
- No verification that worktree exists before proceeding
- No checks that files are being created in correct locations
- No confirmation of proper working directory

### 3. **Protocol Adherence Assumption**
- Agent assumed it was following protocol without verification
### 4. **Missing: Session Environment Activation Examples**
The manual process documentation shows worktree creation and directory switching, but could be clearer about **when and how** to source the session environment.

**Current**: Shows `source ../../sessions/active/2025-10-14-feature-x/.session-env` but doesn't emphasize this is **critical** for proper session operation.

**Needed**: More explicit emphasis that session environment **must** be sourced for proper agent identity and git attribution.

- No self-checking mechanisms in place
- Lack of protocol compliance validation

### 4. **Complexity of Multi-Directory Operations**
- Session requires coordination between multiple directories:
  - Main repo (for session metadata)
  - Worktree (for actual work)
  - Sessions directory (for session files)
- Agent got confused about which operations happen where

## Documentation Gaps Identified

While the protocol is documented, these **enhancements** could prevent future violations:

### 1. **Missing: Explicit Worktree Validation**
Current docs show **how** to use worktrees but lack **validation** that worktree is being used correctly.

**Needed**: "Verify you're in worktree: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Not in worktree directory'"`

### 2. **Missing: File Location Validation**
No guidance on ensuring files are created in correct locations.

**Needed**: "Check file location: `pwd | grep -q '.worktrees/' || echo 'ERROR: Creating file outside worktree'"`

### 3. **Missing: Protocol Compliance Checks**
No self-validation mechanisms mentioned.

**Needed**: Regular protocol compliance validation steps

### 4. **Missing: Error Recovery Procedures**
No guidance on what to do if you realize you're not following protocol.

**Needed**: "If you realize you're working outside worktree: [recovery steps]"

## Recommendations for Protocol Enhancement

### 1. **Add Validation Functions to Session Scripts**
```bash
validate_in_worktree() {
    if [[ ! "$PWD" =~ \.worktrees/ ]]; then
        echo "ERROR: Not in worktree directory. Current: $PWD"
        echo "Expected: .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG/"
        exit 1
    fi
}
```

### 2. **Enhance Documentation with Validation Steps**
- Add "Protocol Compliance Check" sections
- Include validation commands in examples
- Add troubleshooting for protocol violations

### 3. **Create Worktree Usage Guidelines**
- Step-by-step worktree verification procedures
- File location validation checks
- Working directory confirmation protocols

### 4. **Implement Safeguards in Session Templates**
- Include worktree protocol reminders in session templates
- Add validation checkpoints to session workflows
- Create protocol compliance reporting mechanisms

## Conclusion

**The protocol documentation is actually excellent and comprehensive.** The failure was in **execution and decision-making**, not in documentation clarity. The solution is to:

1. **Add validation mechanisms** to prevent protocol violations
2. **Enhance documentation** with explicit validation steps
3. **Create safeguards** that make protocol violations impossible or easily detectable
4. **Implement recovery procedures** for when violations are detected

The core protocol is sound - we just need better **enforcement and validation** mechanisms.
