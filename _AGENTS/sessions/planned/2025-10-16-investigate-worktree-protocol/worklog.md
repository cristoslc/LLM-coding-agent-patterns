## [2025-10-16 00:33] Session Created

Created new session to investigate worktree protocol violations that occurred during the previous session implementation.

## [2025-10-16 00:33] Initial Analysis

Based on the feedback provided, the following protocol violations were identified:

1. **Failure to Create Worktree Initially**: Did not create worktree at session start
2. **Continued Work in Main Folder**: Worked in main directory even after worktree creation
3. **Files Created in Wrong Locations**: Created files scattered across repository root
4. **Loss of PWD Anchoring**: Lost track of current working directory

These violations suggest systematic issues with protocol adherence that need investigation and remediation.

## [2025-10-16 00:34] Investigation Approach

Plan to investigate:
- Review complete interaction history from previous session
- Identify specific decision points where protocol was violated
- Analyze current protocol documentation for clarity gaps
- Document root causes of protocol failures
- Design enhanced protocols with better safeguards
- Create validation mechanisms to prevent future violations

## [2025-10-16 00:35] Documentation Review Completed

Comprehensive analysis of SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md completed. Key findings:

**Protocol Documentation Status**: The worktree protocol is actually **very clearly documented** in both files with:
- Detailed step-by-step worktree creation procedures
- Explicit directory switching instructions (`cd .worktrees/{session-slug}`)
- Session environment activation examples (`source ../../sessions/active/{session-slug}/.session-env`)
- Multiple comprehensive examples showing proper worktree usage

**Root Cause**: The failure was in **execution/decision-making**, not documentation clarity.

## [2025-10-16 00:36] Analysis Findings Documented

Created comprehensive analysis document identifying:

**Primary Issues**:
- Agent decision-making failure at multiple critical points
- Loss of PWD (working directory) anchoring
- Missing validation steps to ensure protocol compliance
- No self-checking mechanisms in place

**Documentation Gaps Identified**:
- Missing worktree validation procedures
- Lack of file location validation checks
- Insufficient protocol compliance verification steps
- Need for error recovery procedures

**Recommendations**:
- Add validation functions to session scripts
- Enhance documentation with explicit validation steps
- Create safeguards preventing protocol violations
- Implement recovery procedures for violation detection

## [2025-10-16 00:37] Session Structure Complete

Session documentation is now complete with:
- Comprehensive SESSION.md with detailed problem analysis
- Active plan with specific investigation tasks
- Detailed analysis findings documenting root causes
- Clear implementation plan for protocol enhancements

Next: Move session to planned status for implementation.
