# Worklog: Align Sessions Protocol

## [2025-10-15] Session Created

Created comprehensive alignment session for sessions protocol files.

**Scope:**
- Review and align all documentation (README, REFERENCE)
- Verify scripts match documented behavior
- Validate templates match script output
- Identify and fix inconsistencies
- Add missing documentation
- Simplify and improve clarity

**Context:**
Recent refactoring has made the protocol session-focused (not agent-focused), but there may be lingering inconsistencies or areas needing improvement across all related files.

**Session Status:** Active - Properly claimed following protocol

## [2025-10-15] Session Claimed and Critical Issue Identified

**Session Claim Process:**
- Moved from manual active → planned
- Properly claimed via `.agents/sessions.lock` 
- Created session branch `session/2025-10-15-align-sessions-protocol`
- Added `.session-env` file

**Critical Issue Discovered:**
User identified that `git checkout -b` changes the base branch in the original directory, which is problematic for multi-agent collaboration. This breaks the isolation principle.

**Solution Implemented:**
Changed protocol to use `git worktree` instead of `git checkout`:
- Creates isolated working directory per session
- Main repo stays on base branch
- Multiple sessions can work simultaneously without interference
- Session work happens in `sessions/active/{session-slug}/worktree/`

**Changes Made to SESSIONS-README.md:**
1. Updated manual process to commit after moving to active (before worktree creation)
2. Changed from `git checkout -b` to `git worktree add -b`
3. Updated activation to work from worktree directory
4. Updated completion process to remove worktree properly
5. Updated directory structure documentation to show worktree
6. Updated all path references to include `/worktree` where appropriate
7. Fixed cleanup steps to handle worktree removal
8. Updated Quick Start section

**Next Steps:**
- Review and update SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md for consistency
- Update `_bin/claim-session` script to use worktree
- Update `_bin/complete-session` script to handle worktree
- Test the new workflow end-to-end
- Update templates if needed

## [2025-10-15] Refined Worktree Approach and Session Lock Management

**Issue 1: Worktree Location**
User asked: Can worktree exist within parent repo?
- Yes, but it creates tracking conflicts
- Session metadata files need to be in main repo
- Worktree files would conflict with session tracking

**Solution:**
- Worktrees live at `.worktrees/{session-slug}/` (repo root level)
- Session metadata stays at `sessions/active/{session-slug}/`
- Clean separation between workspace and metadata
- Added `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore`

**Issue 2: Session Lock Cleanup**
User identified missing session lock cleanup on completion.

**Solution Added:**
- Remove session from `.agents/sessions.lock` during completion
- Use `sed -i '/^{session-id}:/d' .agents/sessions.lock`
- Happens before archiving session to completed/
- Ensures lock file stays clean and accurate

**Additional Changes to SESSIONS-README.md:**
1. Moved worktrees to `.worktrees/` at repo root (not in sessions/)
2. Updated all path references for worktree location
3. Added session lock removal to completion workflow
4. Updated directory structure diagram to show both locations
5. Updated activation paths to reference correct `.session-env` location
6. Created `.gitignore` with `.worktrees/` entry

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Clean separation of workspace vs metadata
- ✅ Session lock accurately reflects active sessions
- ✅ Worktrees don't clutter git tracking
- ✅ Multiple sessions can work simultaneously
- ✅ Easy to see active sessions via `cat .agents/sessions.lock`

## [2025-10-15] Updated SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md for Worktree Consistency

**Changes Made to SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md:**

1. **Utility Scripts Section:**
   - Updated `claim-session` description to include worktree creation
   - Updated `complete-session` description to include worktree removal and lock cleanup
   - Changed activation paths to reference worktree locations

2. **Detailed Implementation Examples:**
   - Updated "Starting a Session" to use `.worktrees/{slug}` path
   - Updated "Working on a Session" to show working from worktree
   - Added note about updating session docs in main repo while in worktree
   - Fixed path navigation (cd ../.. instead of ../../..)
   - Updated completion steps to include worktree removal
   - Fixed environment variable names (SESSION_ID instead of SESSION_BRANCH)

3. **Manual Session Management:**
   - Expanded manual claim process to show all steps including worktree creation
   - Updated manual completion to include worktree removal
   - Added session lock removal with sed command
   - Updated all path references for worktree structure

4. **Git Worktrees Setup (Complete Rewrite):**
   - Changed from agent-based worktrees to session-based worktrees
   - Documented new structure: `.worktrees/{session-slug}/`
   - Showed separation of workspace vs metadata
   - Added examples of multiple concurrent sessions
   - Updated benefits to include "Main repo stays on base branch"
   - Added limitation about `.worktrees/` in `.gitignore`

5. **Session Lock Section:**
   - Added session lock removal commands
   - Documented lifecycle: Claim → Active → Complete (with removal)
   - Added proper git commit examples for lock changes

6. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Updated "Agent Identity Not Showing" to use worktree paths
   - Fixed activation commands to reference correct `.session-env` location

**Consistency Achieved:**
- ✅ All examples now use `.worktrees/{session-slug}` structure
- ✅ All activation paths reference `../../sessions/active/{slug}/.session-env`
- ✅ Session lock cleanup documented in all completion workflows
- ✅ Worktree removal shown in all completion examples
- ✅ Both README and REFERENCE now consistent with each other

## [2025-10-15] Updated Scripts for Worktree Workflow

**Changes to `_bin/claim-session`:**

1. **Step 6 - Move to Active (NEW COMMIT):**
   - Now commits the move to active as separate step
   - Ensures session location is tracked before worktree creation
   - Commit message: `[$SESSION_SLUG] Move to active`

2. **Step 7 - Create .session-env (NEW COMMIT):**
   - Creates activation file with proper environment variables
   - Changed `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` format to: `Cursor-Local-1 (via $USER_NAME)`
   - Added `SESSION_ID` variable (matches `SESSION_SLUG`)
   - Removed `SESSION_BRANCH` variable (replaced by `SESSION_ID`)
   - Commits activation file separately
   - Commit message: `[$SESSION_SLUG] Add session environment`

3. **Step 8 - Create Worktree (REPLACES CHECKOUT):**
   - Uses `git worktree add -b session/$SESSION_SLUG .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG HEAD`
   - Creates isolated workspace at `.worktrees/{slug}`
   - No longer changes branch in main repo
   - Automatic branch creation with worktree

4. **Updated Instructions:**
   - Shows worktree location: `.worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG`
   - Shows metadata location: `_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG`
   - Activation command: `cd .worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG && source ../../_AGENTS/sessions/active/$SESSION_SLUG/.session-env`

**Changes to `_bin/complete-session`:**

1. **Step 1 - Generate Patch (UPDATED):**
   - Checks if worktree exists before generating patch
   - If worktree exists: generates from worktree location
   - If worktree missing: attempts from current location with warning
   - Saves patch to session metadata directory

2. **Step 3 - Remove Worktree (NEW):**
   - Removes worktree at `.worktrees/$SESSION_SLUG`
   - Uses `git worktree remove` with fallback to `--force` if needed
   - Checks if worktree exists before attempting removal
   - Shows warning if worktree not found

3. **Step 4 - Merge to Main (UPDATED):**
   - Removed `git checkout main` (already on main in repo root)
   - Squash merges session branch to main
   - Pushes immediately after commit

4. **Step 5 - Release Session Lock (NEW):**
   - Removes session from `.agents/sessions.lock`
   - Uses `sed -i "/^$SESSION_SLUG:/d" .agents/sessions.lock`
   - Stages lock file for commit

5. **Step 6 - Move to Completed (REORDERED):**
   - Now happens after lock removal
   - Combined with lock file commit
   - Commit message: `[$SESSION_SLUG] Archive session`

6. **Step 7 - Cleanup Branch (SAME):**
   - Deletes session branch with `git branch -d`

7. **Updated Output:**
   - Shows all artifact locations clearly
   - Fixed variable names in deactivation reminder (SESSION_ID not SESSION_BRANCH)
   - Removed worktree cleanup reminder (now handled automatically)

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Scripts now match documented workflow exactly
- ✅ Proper commit sequence (claim → move → env → worktree)
- ✅ Session lock properly managed (add on claim, remove on complete)
- ✅ Worktree creation and removal automated
- ✅ Main repo never changes branches
- ✅ Clear feedback at each step
- ✅ Error handling for missing worktrees
