# Phase 2 Summary: Design Passive Restraints

## Overview

Phase 2 focused on designing comprehensive passive restraint mechanisms to prevent protocol violations in the Agent Sessions Protocol. This phase did NOT implement these designs but created detailed specifications for implementation in Phase 3.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. Git Hooks Design (`git-hooks-design.md`)

**Summary**: Designed pre-commit and pre-push hooks with a safe installation method.

**Key Features**:
- Pre-commit hook: Prevents commits to non-session branches and from outside worktrees
- Pre-push hook: Ensures only session branches can be pushed
- Hook wrapper pattern: Integrates with existing hooks without overwriting
- Installation script: Safely installs hooks into `.git/hooks/hooks.d/`
- Rollback procedure: Easy removal if needed

**Critical Innovation**: Hooks.d directory pattern allows multiple hooks to coexist.

### 2. Shell Environment Enhancement (`shell-environment-design.md`)

**Summary**: Designed enhanced PS1 prompt with visual indicators.

**Key Features**:
- Branch name display in prompt
- Worktree status indicator ([WORKTREE] or [MAIN])
- Color coding (green=safe, yellow=warning, red=danger)
- Compatible with bash and zsh
- Integrated with session environment activation
- Validation helper functions

**Critical Innovation**: Always-visible context reduces "PWD anchoring loss".

### 3. Environment Variable Enforcement (`environment-variables-design.md`)

**Summary**: Defined core session variables and their enforcement.

**Key Features**:
- Core variables: SESSION_SLUG, SESSION_BRANCH, SESSION_DIR
- Supporting variables: SESSION_ACTIVE, SESSION_START_TIME
- Validation functions to check variable presence and correctness
- Automatic validation on environment sourcing
- Prevention of double-sourcing
- Session deactivation function

**Critical Innovation**: Complete .session-env template with all features integrated.

### 4. Agent Awareness Guidelines (`agent-awareness-guidelines.md`)

**Summary**: Explicit instructions for agents on using environmental indicators.

**Key Features**:
- Hierarchy of indicators (PS1 → Env Vars → PWD → Git Branch)
- Decision trees for different scenarios
- Error recovery procedures
- Operational safety checklists
- Training scenarios with examples
- Quick reference card

**Critical Innovation**: Transforms passive restraints into actionable agent behavior.

### 5. File System Guardrails (`filesystem-guardrails-design.md`)

**Summary**: Strategies for controlling file creation locations.

**Key Features**:
- Path validation functions
- Shell function overrides (touch, mkdir, etc.)
- .roo/rules integration
- Audit and cleanup scripts
- Pre-commit hook integration
- Layered defense (preventive, detective, corrective)

**Critical Innovation**: Multi-layered approach catches violations at multiple points.

### 6. Temporary User Investigation (`temporary-user-investigation.md`)

**Summary**: Evaluated OS-level user restrictions for session isolation.

**Key Findings**:
- Technically possible but platform-specific
- Requires elevated privileges (sudo/admin)
- Complex implementation across OS platforms
- Breaks development tool workflows
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Do NOT pursue
- **ALTERNATIVE**: Multi-layered soft restrictions (already designed)
- **OPTIONAL**: Docker-based isolation for advanced users

**Critical Decision**: Soft restrictions are sufficient; user-based isolation adds too much complexity.

### 7. Per-Session Cloning Evaluation (`per-session-cloning-evaluation.md`)

**Summary**: Evaluated cloning vs worktrees for session isolation.

**Key Findings**:
- **Worktrees**: Fast, disk-efficient, but complex for agents
- **Full Clones**: Simple, isolated, but slow and disk-heavy
- **Reference Clones**: Best of both worlds!
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Implement reference clone support as default
- **STRATEGY**: Keep worktrees as option, migrate to reference clones

**Critical Discovery**: Reference clones provide worktree-like efficiency with clone-like simplicity.

## Key Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (Phase 3)

1. **Implement Git Hooks** (git-hooks-design.md)
   - Create hook scripts
   - Implement installation mechanism
   - Test with existing workflow

2. **Implement Enhanced Shell Environment** (shell-environment-design.md)
   - Update .session-env template
   - Add validation functions
   - Integrate with claim-session script

3. **Implement Environment Variables** (environment-variables-design.md)
   - Already mostly covered by shell environment design
   - Ensure complete .session-env template

4. **Create .roo/rules File**
   - Define session protocol rules
   - Integrate file system guardrails
   - Reference agent awareness guidelines

### Medium-Term Priorities

5. **Implement File System Guardrails** (filesystem-guardrails-design.md)
   - Add shell function overrides to .session-env
   - Create audit/cleanup scripts
   - Integrate with pre-commit hooks

6. **Document Agent Awareness** (agent-awareness-guidelines.md)
   - Add to SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md
   - Create training materials
   - Update .roo/rules with references

### Long-Term Priorities

7. **Implement Reference Clone Support** (per-session-cloning-evaluation.md)
   - Create claim-session --mode=ref-clone option
   - Test with existing workflow
   - Gradually migrate to default

8. **Optional Docker Support** (temporary-user-investigation.md)
   - Create session container template
   - Document Docker workflow
   - Provide for users needing maximum isolation

## Design Patterns Discovered

### 1. Layered Defense

Multiple independent mechanisms that reinforce each other:
- Git hooks (prevent at commit time)
- Shell overrides (prevent at creation time)
- Agent awareness (prevent at decision time)
- Environment validation (detect at runtime)

### 2. Passive + Active Integration

Passive restraints (automatic enforcement) combined with active guidance (agent behavior):
- Passive: Hooks, validators, prompts
- Active: Guidelines, checklists, training

### 3. Clear Visual Feedback

Always-visible indicators reduce cognitive load:
- Colored prompts (immediate status)
- Environment variables (queryable state)
- Validation functions (explicit checks)

### 4. Fail-Safe Defaults

Systems designed to prevent mistakes by default:
- Hooks block bad operations
- Validators warn before errors
- Clear error messages guide recovery

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Multi-Layered Soft Restrictions vs OS-Level Users

**Chosen**: Multi-layered soft restrictions

**Rationale**:
- No elevated privileges required
- Cross-platform compatible
- Tool-friendly
- Sufficient protection
- Lower complexity

### Decision 2: Worktrees vs Clones vs Reference Clones

**Chosen**: Reference clones as future default, keep worktrees as option

**Rationale**:
- Reference clones combine benefits of both
- Better agent simplicity
- Complete isolation
- Disk efficient
- Gradual migration path

### Decision 3: Preventive vs Detective vs Corrective

**Chosen**: All three (layered defense)

**Rationale**:
- Prevention stops errors before they happen
- Detection catches what prevention misses
- Correction handles edge cases
- Redundancy ensures reliability

## Implementation Readiness

All designs are **implementation-ready**:

- ✅ Detailed specifications provided

## Success Metrics
