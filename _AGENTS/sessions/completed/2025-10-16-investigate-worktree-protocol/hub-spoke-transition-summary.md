# Hub-Spoke Architecture Transition Summary

## Executive Decision

**Decision**: Replace Git worktrees with hub-and-spoke architecture using shallow clones for the Agent Sessions Protocol.

**Rationale**: The investigation revealed that worktrees introduce conceptual complexity that consistently leads to protocol violations by AI agents. The hub-and-spoke approach provides a simpler, more reliable workflow.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Session Documents Updated

#### SESSION.md
- Updated title and context to reflect hub-spoke architecture
- Added investigation findings and architectural decision
- Updated acceptance criteria and implementation plan
- Added architecture benefits and risk mitigation

#### analysis-findings.md
- Completely rewritten to focus on hub-spoke transition
- Updated root cause analysis to identify conceptual complexity as primary issue
- Added architectural decision and implementation strategy
- Updated remediation strategies for session clones

#### agent-awareness-guidelines.md
- Updated for hub-spoke architecture context
- Changed all references from worktrees to session clones
- Updated PS1 prompt indicators from `[WORKTREE]` to `[SESSION]`
- Updated directory paths from `.worktrees/` to `.sessions/`

### 2. Protocol Documentation Updated

#### SESSIONS-README.md
- Updated quick start examples to use session clones
- Changed directory structure from `.worktrees/` to `.sessions/`
- Updated manual session creation and completion processes
- Modified core principles to emphasize hub-spoke architecture

#### SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md
- Updated table of contents to reflect hub-spoke architecture
- Replaced "Git Worktrees Setup" section with "Hub-Spoke Architecture Setup"
- Updated all examples to use session clones instead of worktrees
- Modified utility script descriptions for new workflow

## Architecture Comparison

| Aspect | Worktrees (Previous) | Hub-Spoke (New) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Concept** | Shared Git state, separate working directories | Independent repositories |
| **Complexity** | High - requires special Git concepts | Low - standard Git workflow |
| **Isolation** | Partial - shares `.git` directory | Complete - independent repos |
| **Setup** | `git worktree add` commands | `git clone --depth 1` |
| **Directory** | `.worktrees/{session}/` | `.sessions/{session}/` |
| **Workflow** | Non-standard operations | Standard Git operations |
| **Agent Understanding** | Complex concepts to learn | Familiar workflow |

## Benefits of Hub-Spoke Architecture

### For Agents
- **Simpler Mental Model**: Standard Git repository, no special concepts
- **Clear Boundaries**: Each session is a separate directory
- **Standard Workflow**: Normal Git operations apply
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: No worktree-specific knowledge needed

### For System
- **Complete Isolation**: Sessions cannot interfere with each other
- **Network Independence**: Sessions work offline
- **Centralized Cloud Access**: Only main repo needs credentials
- **Robust and Reliable**: No fragile dependencies

### For Workflow
- **Fast Session Creation**: Shallow clones are quick to create
- **Easy Cleanup**: Just delete the session directory
- **Scalable**: Can support many concurrent sessions
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any filesystem

## Implementation Details

### Session Clone Creation
```bash
# New method (hub-spoke)
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch main \
  . .sessions/2025-10-16-session
cd .sessions/2025-10-16-session
git checkout -b session/2025-10-16-session
git remote rename origin upstream
```

### Session Activation
```bash
# New method
cd .sessions/2025-10-16-session
source ../../sessions/active/2025-10-16-session/.session-env
```

### Session Cleanup
```bash
# New method
rm -rf .sessions/2025-10-16-session
```

## Updated Passive Restraints

### PS1 Prompt Changes
- **Before**: `[WORKTREE]` indicator for worktrees
- **After**: `[SESSION]` indicator for session clones
- **Color coding**: Green for correct session, Red for main repo

### Directory Validation
- **Before**: Check for `.worktrees/` in path
- **After**: Check for `.sessions/` in path
- **Validation**: Ensure operations happen within session clone

### Environment Variables
- **SESSION_DIR**: Now points to session clone directory
- **SESSION_BRANCH**: Still session/{session-slug} format
- **SESSION_SLUG**: Unchanged session identifier

## Migration Strategy

### For Existing Worktree Sessions
1. Complete existing worktree sessions as planned
2. New sessions will use hub-spoke architecture
3. Support both approaches during transition period
4. Eventually deprecate worktree approach

### For Scripts and Automation
1. Update `claim-session` script to create session clones
2. Update `complete-session` script to clean up session clones
3. Modify passive restraint checks for new directory structure
4. Update documentation and examples

## Risk Mitigation

### Disk Space Usage
- **Risk**: Session clones use more disk space than worktrees
- **Mitigation**: Shallow clones minimize disk usage, document cleanup procedures

### Migration Complexity
- **Risk**: Transition may be complex for existing workflows
- **Mitigation**: Support both approaches during transition, provide clear documentation

### Cloud Access
- **Risk**: Only main repo has cloud connectivity
- **Mitigation**: This is actually a benefit - centralized cloud access is more secure

## Success Metrics

### Protocol Violations
- **Target**: Zero protocol violations with new architecture
- **Measurement**: Track session compliance and error rates

### Agent Understanding
- **Target**: Agents can reliably follow workflow without errors
- **Measurement**: Monitor session completion success rates

### System Reliability
- **Target**: No fragile dependencies or complex failure modes
- **Measurement**: Track system stability and error recovery

## Next Steps

1. **Update Session Scripts**: Modify `claim-session` and `complete-session` for hub-spoke
2. **Test New Workflow**: Validate hub-spoke architecture with test sessions
3. **Update Passive Restraints**: Implement new validation mechanisms
4. **Create Migration Guide**: Document transition process
5. **Train Agents**: Update agent guidelines and training materials

## Conclusion

The transition to hub-and-spoke architecture addresses the root causes of protocol violations by simplifying the conceptual model and using standard Git workflows. This change will improve reliability, reduce agent errors, and make the Agent Sessions Protocol more maintainable and scalable.

The investigation successfully identified that the issue was not just missing passive restraints, but fundamental architectural complexity. By replacing worktrees with a simpler, more intuitive approach, we can achieve better protocol compliance and agent success.
