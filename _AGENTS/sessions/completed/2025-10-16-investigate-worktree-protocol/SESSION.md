# Session: Investigate Worktree Protocol Issues and Implement Hub-Spoke Architecture

## Context
During the implementation of session "2025-10-15-fix-session-scripts", the agent (myself) failed to properly follow the Agent Sessions Protocol worktree workflow. This resulted in files being created in incorrect locations, working in the wrong directory, and generally not adhering to the established session management procedures. This session will investigate the root causes of these protocol violations and implement a transition to a hub-and-spoke architecture using shallow clones to prevent future occurrences.

## Problem Statement
The following protocol violations occurred during the previous session implementation:

1. **Failure to Create Worktree Initially**: The agent did not create a worktree at the start of the session, instead working directly in the main repository directory.

2. **Continued Work in Main Folder After Worktree Creation**: Even after the worktree was eventually created, the agent continued to work in the main folder instead of switching to the worktree directory.

3. **Files Created in Wrong Locations**: Files were created scattered across the repository root directory instead of being properly contained within the session directory structure.

4. **Loss of Working Directory Anchoring**: The agent lost track of the current working directory (PWD anchoring), leading to files being created in unintended locations.

These violations suggest fundamental issues with either:
- The protocol documentation not being clear enough about worktree usage
- The agent's understanding of when and how to use worktrees
- Missing validation steps to ensure proper worktree usage
- Inadequate safeguards against working directory confusion
- **The worktree approach itself being too complex for reliable agent execution**

## Investigation Findings

### Root Cause Analysis
Through comprehensive investigation, the primary issues were identified as:

1. **Agent Decision-Making Failure**: The agent consistently failed to follow explicit worktree instructions
2. **Missing Passive Restraints**: Lack of automatic enforcement mechanisms
3. **Worktree Conceptual Complexity**: Worktrees introduce cognitive overhead that leads to errors
4. **Shared State Confusion**: Worktrees share Git state, making boundaries unclear

### Critical Discovery: Hub-Spoke Superiority
Investigation of alternative approaches revealed that a **hub-and-spoke architecture with shallow clones** is superior for agent sessions:

- **Simpler Mental Model**: Standard Git workflow, no special concepts
- **Complete Isolation**: Each session is truly independent
- **Ephemeral by Nature**: Sessions are temporary, shallow clones are temporary
- **Network Independence**: Sessions work offline, only main repo connects to cloud
- **Robust and Reliable**: No fragile dependencies, works across filesystems

## Architecture Decision

### Decision: Replace Worktrees with Hub-Spoke Shallow Clones

**Rationale**:
1. **Aligns with Ephemeral Nature**: Sessions are temporary by definition
2. **Simplifies Agent Understanding**: Standard Git workflow, no worktree concepts
3. **Maximizes Isolation**: Each session is completely independent
4. **Minimizes Risk**: Clear boundaries, hard to violate protocol
5. **Optimizes for Local Work**: Fast creation, offline capability
6. **Centralizes Cloud Access**: Only main repo needs credentials/config

### New Architecture
```
Cloud (GitHub)
    ↓
Main Repo (on-disk, full history)
    ↓
Session Clones (shallow, ephemeral)
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis (Day 1) ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Review Session Transcripts**: Analyze the complete interaction history from the previous session
2. **Identify Decision Points**: Map out where worktree creation should have occurred vs where it actually happened
3. **Analyze File Creation Patterns**: Document where files were created vs where they should have been created
4. **Review Protocol Documentation**: Examine current SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md for worktree guidance
5. **Evaluate Alternatives**: Research shallow clones, reference clones, and hub-spoke architecture

### Phase 2: Design New Architecture (Day 2-3) ✅ COMPLETED
6. **Design Hub-Spoke Architecture**: Define main repo as hub, sessions as shallow clone spokes
7. **Design Git Hooks and installation method**: Define pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks to enforce branch adherence and session isolation
8. **Enhance Shell Environment**: Determine how to modify the `PS1` prompt to display the current Git branch and session status
9. **Implement Environment Variable Enforcement**: Define and enforce `SESSION_SLUG`, `SESSION_BRANCH`, and `SESSION_DIR` variables in the session environment
10. **Develop Agent Awareness Guidelines**: Create explicit instructions for agents to check the `PS1` prompt and environment variables for their operational context
11. **Establish File System Guardrails**: Consider strategies and rules for allowed file creation locations within the session clone
12. **Evaluate Cloning Strategies**: Compare shallow clones vs reference clones vs full clones
13. **Design Session Scripts**: Update claim-session and complete-session for hub-spoke workflow

### Phase 3: Documentation Updates (Day 4)
14. **Update SESSIONS-README.md**: Replace worktree documentation with hub-spoke architecture
15. **Update SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md**: Update all examples and procedures for shallow clone workflow
16. **Create Migration Guide**: Document how to transition from worktrees to shallow clones
17. **Update Session Templates**: Modify templates to reflect new architecture
18. **Document Best Practices**: Create guidelines for hub-spoke workflow

### Phase 4: Implementation and Testing (Day 5-6)
19. **Implement Updated Session Scripts**: Modify claim-session and complete-session scripts
20. **Test New Workflow**: Validate hub-spoke architecture with test sessions
21. **Update Passive Restraints**: Adapt all designed mechanisms for shallow clones
22. **Create Rollback Procedures**: Document how to revert if needed
23. **Final Documentation Review**: Ensure all documentation is consistent and complete

### Phase 3: Integrate and Validate Passive Restraints (Day 4-5)
10. **Integrate Passive Restraints**: Create and Apply the designed Git hooks, shell environment enhancements, and file system guardrails into the Agent Sessions Protocol.
11. **Update Session Scripts**: Modify `claim-session` and `complete-session` scripts to leverage and validate against the new passive restraints.
12. **Create Validation Test Cases**: Develop automated tests to verify that the implemented passive restraints successfully prevent protocol violations (e.g., committing to the wrong branch, creating files outside the worktree).
13. **Document Remediation Strategies**: Update `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md` with detailed documentation of the new passive restraint mechanisms and their usage.

### Phase 4: Refinement and Knowledge Transfer (Day 6)
14. **Refine Agent Guidance**: Based on testing, refine the agent's internal guidance and `.roo/rules` to ensure optimal interaction with the new passive restraints.
15. **Document Learnings**: Create comprehensive documentation of findings, implemented solutions, and best practices for future agent development.
16. **Create KB Merge Session**: If significant knowledge is captured, create a KB merge session to integrate these findings into the broader knowledge base.

## Success Metrics
- **Zero protocol violations**: Future sessions consistently follow worktree protocol
- **Clear documentation**: Worktree usage is unambiguously documented with examples
- **Validation success**: New validation mechanisms successfully detect and prevent violations
- **Agent compliance**: Agent consistently works in correct directories during sessions
- **File location accuracy**: All session files are created in appropriate locations

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Documentation becomes too verbose and complex
  - **Mitigation**: Keep documentation concise but comprehensive, use clear examples
- **Risk**: Validation mechanisms become annoying or interfere with work
  - **Mitigation**: Make validations helpful and non-intrusive, provide clear guidance
- **Risk**: Agent still doesn't follow protocol due to fundamental understanding issues
  - **Mitigation**: Include explicit reasoning for why worktree protocol is important
