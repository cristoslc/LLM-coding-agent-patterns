# Worklog: Implement Read-Only SESSION.md

## [2025-10-15] Session Created

Created session to implement read-only protection for SESSION.md files during active work.

**Priority:** Medium - Important for drift tracking but not blocking.

**Scope:**
- Update claim-session to set SESSION.md read-only
- Update complete-session to unlock SESSION.md
- Update all documentation to explain the feature
- Update templates with read-only reminders
- Test the feature end-to-end
- Document override process for edge cases

**Context:**
This was part of the original `2025-10-15-align-sessions-protocol` acceptance criteria but was descoped during implementation. Now addressing it as a standalone feature.

**Why This Matters:**
Preserving the original plan enables drift analysis - comparing what was planned vs. what actually happened. This helps improve future session planning and catches scope creep early.

## [2025-10-15] Status Update

Session moved from **drafting** to **planned** status. Ready for agent to claim and begin work.

**Session Status:** Planned - ready for agent to claim

## [2025-10-15] Session Completed

✅ **Successfully implemented read-only SESSION.md protection**

**What was accomplished:**

### ✅ Script Updates
- **claim-session**: Now sets SESSION.md to read-only (chmod 444) after moving to active/
- **complete-session**: Unlocks SESSION.md (chmod 644) for final updates, then sets back to read-only in completed/
- Both scripts provide clear messaging about read-only protection

### ✅ Documentation Updates
- **SESSIONS-README.md**: Added comprehensive section explaining read-only protection, purpose, and override process
- **SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md**: Updated manual workflow examples with chmod commands and troubleshooting section
- Added FAQ entries explaining why SESSION.md is read-only and how to track scope changes

### ✅ Template Updates
- Added read-only protection note to SESSION.md files (serves as template for future sessions)
- Clear guidance on which files to use for updates during active work

### ✅ Testing & Validation
- Verified claim-session sets permissions correctly (444)
- Confirmed editing SESSION.md fails with clear "Permission denied" error
- Tested complete-session unlock/re-lock process
- Validated manual override process works for emergencies
- Documented all test results and edge cases

### ✅ Edge Cases Handled
- Pre-existing sessions handled gracefully
- Manual session moves documented with proper chmod commands
- Emergency override process clearly documented with warnings
- Clear guidance on when override is acceptable (critical errors only)

**Key Benefits Delivered:**
- **Drift Analysis**: Original plans preserved for comparing planned vs. actual work
- **Scope Creep Prevention**: Clear separation of update channels prevents accidental SESSION.md modifications
- **Learning Improvement**: Future session planning enhanced through drift analysis
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability of original intent vs. actual execution

**Session Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All acceptance criteria met
