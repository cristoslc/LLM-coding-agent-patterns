# Session: Investigate Worktree Protocol Issues and Fix Protocol Documentation

## Context
During the implementation of session "2025-10-15-fix-session-scripts", the agent (myself) failed to properly follow the Agent Sessions Protocol worktree workflow. This resulted in files being created in incorrect locations, working in the wrong directory, and generally not adhering to the established session management procedures. This session will investigate the root causes of these protocol violations and implement fixes to prevent future occurrences.

## Problem Statement
The following protocol violations occurred during the previous session implementation:

1. **Failure to Create Worktree Initially**: The agent did not create a worktree at the start of the session, instead working directly in the main repository directory.

2. **Continued Work in Main Folder After Worktree Creation**: Even after the worktree was eventually created, the agent continued to work in the main folder instead of switching to the worktree directory.

3. **Files Created in Wrong Locations**: Files were created scattered across the repository root directory instead of being properly contained within the session directory structure.

4. **Loss of Working Directory Anchoring**: The agent lost track of the current working directory (PWD anchoring), leading to files being created in unintended locations.

These violations suggest fundamental issues with either:
- The protocol documentation not being clear enough about worktree usage
- The agent's understanding of when and how to use worktrees
- Missing validation steps to ensure proper worktree usage
- Inadequate safeguards against working directory confusion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**: Complete investigation of why worktree protocol was not followed
- [ ] **Protocol Documentation Review**: Review and enhance SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md for worktree clarity
- [ ] **Worktree Usage Guidelines**: Create clear, step-by-step guidelines for worktree usage in sessions
- [ ] **Validation Mechanisms**: Implement checks to ensure worktree is being used correctly
- [ ] **PWD Anchoring Solutions**: Develop methods to prevent working directory confusion
- [ ] **Session Template Updates**: Update session templates to include worktree protocol reminders
- [ ] **Documentation Examples**: Provide concrete examples of proper vs improper worktree usage
- [ ] **Prevention Mechanisms**: Create safeguards that prevent working outside worktree when required

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis (Day 1)
1. **Review Session Transcripts**: Analyze the complete interaction history from the previous session
2. **Identify Decision Points**: Map out where worktree creation should have occurred vs where it actually happened
3. **Analyze File Creation Patterns**: Document where files were created vs where they should have been created
4. **Review Protocol Documentation**: Examine current SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md for worktree guidance

### Phase 2: Design and Implement Passive Restraints (Day 2-3)
5. **Design and Install Git Hooks**: Define and implement pre-commit and pre-push Git hooks to enforce branch adherence and worktree usage. Crucially, design an installation method that *appends* to or *integrates with* any pre-existing hooks, rather than overwriting them.
6. **Enhance Shell Environment**: Modify the `PS1` prompt to display the current Git branch and worktree status.
7. **Implement Environment Variable Enforcement**: Define and enforce `SESSION_SLUG`, `SESSION_BRANCH`, and `SESSION_DIR` variables in the session environment.
8. **Develop Agent Awareness Guidelines**: Create explicit instructions for agents to check the `PS1` prompt and environment variables for their operational context, and to source the session environment if not active.
9. **Establish File System Guardrails**: Define rules for allowed file creation locations within the worktree.
10. **Investigate Temporary User with Restricted Permissions**: Research the feasibility of creating a temporary, platform-agnostic (macOS, Linux, Windows) user with permissions restricted to only the worktree, and read-only access to other repository files, to prevent unauthorized edits.
11. **Evaluate Per-Session Cloning as an Alternative**: Investigate the feasibility and implications of dropping Git worktrees in favor of creating a fresh clone of the repository for each session, to ensure complete isolation and prevent cross-session interference. This would be an alternative to worktree-specific guardrails.

### Phase 3: Integrate and Validate Passive Restraints (Day 4-5)
10. **Integrate Passive Restraints**: Apply the designed Git hooks, shell environment enhancements, and file system guardrails into the Agent Sessions Protocol.
11. **Update Session Scripts**: Modify `claim-session` and `complete-session` scripts to leverage and validate against the new passive restraints.
12. **Create Validation Test Cases**: Develop automated tests to verify that the implemented passive restraints successfully prevent protocol violations (e.g., committing to the wrong branch, creating files outside the worktree).
13. **Document Remediation Strategies**: Update `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md` with detailed documentation of the new passive restraint mechanisms and their usage.

### Phase 4: Refinement and Knowledge Transfer (Day 6)
14. **Refine Agent Guidance**: Based on testing, refine the agent's internal guidance and `.roo/rules` to ensure optimal interaction with the new passive restraints.
15. **Document Learnings**: Create comprehensive documentation of findings, implemented solutions, and best practices for future agent development.
16. **Create KB Merge Session**: If significant knowledge is captured, create a KB merge session to integrate these findings into the broader knowledge base.

## Success Metrics
- **Zero protocol violations**: Future sessions consistently follow worktree protocol
- **Clear documentation**: Worktree usage is unambiguously documented with examples
- **Validation success**: New validation mechanisms successfully detect and prevent violations
- **Agent compliance**: Agent consistently works in correct directories during sessions
- **File location accuracy**: All session files are created in appropriate locations

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Documentation becomes too verbose and complex
  - **Mitigation**: Keep documentation concise but comprehensive, use clear examples
- **Risk**: Validation mechanisms become annoying or interfere with work
  - **Mitigation**: Make validations helpful and non-intrusive, provide clear guidance
- **Risk**: Agent still doesn't follow protocol due to fundamental understanding issues
  - **Mitigation**: Include explicit reasoning for why worktree protocol is important

## Dependencies
- Access to complete session interaction history
- Understanding of Agent Sessions Protocol requirements
- Knowledge of worktree mechanics and benefits
- Ability to modify protocol documentation and templates

## Original Implementation Plan
1. Analyze the complete interaction history from the previous session
2. Identify specific points where protocol was violated
3. Review current protocol documentation for clarity gaps
4. Enhance documentation with clearer worktree usage instructions
5. Create validation mechanisms to ensure protocol compliance
6. Update session templates and scripts with safeguards
7. Test the new mechanisms to ensure they prevent violations
8. Document findings and create KB merge session if needed
