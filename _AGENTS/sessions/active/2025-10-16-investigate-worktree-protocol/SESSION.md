# Session: Investigate Worktree Protocol Issues and Fix Protocol Documentation

## Context
During the implementation of session "2025-10-15-fix-session-scripts", the agent (myself) failed to properly follow the Agent Sessions Protocol worktree workflow. This resulted in files being created in incorrect locations, working in the wrong directory, and generally not adhering to the established session management procedures. This session will investigate the root causes of these protocol violations and implement fixes to prevent future occurrences.

## Problem Statement
The following protocol violations occurred during the previous session implementation:

1. **Failure to Create Worktree Initially**: The agent did not create a worktree at the start of the session, instead working directly in the main repository directory.

2. **Continued Work in Main Folder After Worktree Creation**: Even after the worktree was eventually created, the agent continued to work in the main folder instead of switching to the worktree directory.

3. **Files Created in Wrong Locations**: Files were created scattered across the repository root directory instead of being properly contained within the session directory structure.

4. **Loss of Working Directory Anchoring**: The agent lost track of the current working directory (PWD anchoring), leading to files being created in unintended locations.

These violations suggest fundamental issues with either:
- The protocol documentation not being clear enough about worktree usage
- The agent's understanding of when and how to use worktrees
- Missing validation steps to ensure proper worktree usage
- Inadequate safeguards against working directory confusion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**: Complete investigation of why worktree protocol was not followed
- [ ] **Protocol Documentation Review**: Review and enhance SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md for worktree clarity
- [ ] **Worktree Usage Guidelines**: Create clear, step-by-step guidelines for worktree usage in sessions
- [ ] **Validation Mechanisms**: Implement checks to ensure worktree is being used correctly
- [ ] **PWD Anchoring Solutions**: Develop methods to prevent working directory confusion
- [ ] **Session Template Updates**: Update session templates to include worktree protocol reminders
- [ ] **Documentation Examples**: Provide concrete examples of proper vs improper worktree usage
- [ ] **Prevention Mechanisms**: Create safeguards that prevent working outside worktree when required

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis (Day 1)
1. **Review Session Transcripts**: Analyze the complete interaction history from the previous session
2. **Identify Decision Points**: Map out where worktree creation should have occurred vs where it actually happened
3. **Analyze File Creation Patterns**: Document where files were created vs where they should have been created
4. **Review Protocol Documentation**: Examine current SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md for worktree guidance

### Phase 2: Documentation Enhancement (Day 2)
5. **Enhance Worktree Documentation**: Add clear, explicit instructions about worktree usage
6. **Create Step-by-Step Guides**: Develop detailed procedures for worktree creation and usage
7. **Add Examples and Warnings**: Include concrete examples of proper worktree usage and warnings about common mistakes
8. **Update Session Templates**: Modify session templates to include worktree protocol checkpoints

### Phase 3: Validation and Safeguards (Day 3)
9. **Create Validation Scripts**: Develop scripts to verify worktree is being used correctly
10. **Implement PWD Anchoring**: Create mechanisms to prevent working directory confusion
11. **Add Protocol Checkpoints**: Insert validation steps in session workflows
12. **Test Prevention Mechanisms**: Verify that new safeguards prevent protocol violations

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Day 4)
13. **Update Session Scripts**: Modify claim-session and complete-session scripts with worktree validation
14. **Create Test Cases**: Develop tests to verify protocol compliance
15. **Document Learnings**: Create comprehensive documentation of findings and solutions
16. **Create KB Merge Session**: If significant knowledge is captured, create KB merge session

## Success Metrics
- **Zero protocol violations**: Future sessions consistently follow worktree protocol
- **Clear documentation**: Worktree usage is unambiguously documented with examples
- **Validation success**: New validation mechanisms successfully detect and prevent violations
- **Agent compliance**: Agent consistently works in correct directories during sessions
- **File location accuracy**: All session files are created in appropriate locations

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Documentation becomes too verbose and complex
  - **Mitigation**: Keep documentation concise but comprehensive, use clear examples
- **Risk**: Validation mechanisms become annoying or interfere with work
  - **Mitigation**: Make validations helpful and non-intrusive, provide clear guidance
- **Risk**: Agent still doesn't follow protocol due to fundamental understanding issues
  - **Mitigation**: Include explicit reasoning for why worktree protocol is important

## Dependencies
- Access to complete session interaction history
- Understanding of Agent Sessions Protocol requirements
- Knowledge of worktree mechanics and benefits
- Ability to modify protocol documentation and templates

## Original Implementation Plan
1. Analyze the complete interaction history from the previous session
2. Identify specific points where protocol was violated
3. Review current protocol documentation for clarity gaps
4. Enhance documentation with clearer worktree usage instructions
5. Create validation mechanisms to ensure protocol compliance
6. Update session templates and scripts with safeguards
7. Test the new mechanisms to ensure they prevent violations
8. Document findings and create KB merge session if needed
