## [2025-10-16 00:33] Session Created

Created new session to investigate worktree protocol violations that occurred during the previous session implementation.

## [2025-10-16 00:33] Initial Analysis

Based on the feedback provided, the following protocol violations were identified:

1. **Failure to Create Worktree Initially**: Did not create worktree at session start
2. **Continued Work in Main Folder**: Worked in main directory even after worktree creation
3. **Files Created in Wrong Locations**: Created files scattered across repository root
4. **Loss of PWD Anchoring**: Lost track of current working directory

These violations suggest systematic issues with protocol adherence that need investigation and remediation.

## [2025-10-16 00:34] Investigation Approach

Plan to investigate:
- Review complete interaction history from previous session
- Identify specific decision points where protocol was violated
- Analyze current protocol documentation for clarity gaps
- Document root causes of protocol failures
- Design enhanced protocols with better safeguards
- Create validation mechanisms to prevent future violations

## [2025-10-16 00:35] Documentation Review Completed

Comprehensive analysis of SESSIONS-README.md and SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md completed. Key findings:

**Protocol Documentation Status**: The worktree protocol is actually **very clearly documented** in both files with:
- Detailed step-by-step worktree creation procedures
- Explicit directory switching instructions (`cd .worktrees/{session-slug}`)
- Session environment activation examples (`source ../../sessions/active/{session-slug}/.session-env`)
- Multiple comprehensive examples showing proper worktree usage

**Root Cause**: The failure was in **execution/decision-making**, not documentation clarity.

## [2025-10-16 00:36] Analysis Findings Documented

Created comprehensive analysis document identifying:

**Primary Issues**:
- Agent decision-making failure at multiple critical points
- Loss of PWD (working directory) anchoring
- Missing validation steps to ensure protocol compliance
- No self-checking mechanisms in place

**Documentation Gaps Identified**:
- Missing worktree validation procedures
- Lack of file location validation checks
- Insufficient protocol compliance verification steps
- Need for error recovery procedures

**Recommendations**:
- Add validation functions to session scripts
- Enhance documentation with explicit validation steps
- Create safeguards preventing protocol violations
- Implement recovery procedures for violation detection

## [2025-10-16 00:37] Session Structure Complete

Session documentation is now complete with:
- Comprehensive SESSION.md with detailed problem analysis
- Active plan with specific investigation tasks
- Detailed analysis findings documenting root causes
- Clear implementation plan for protocol enhancements

Next: Move session to planned status for implementation.

## [2025-10-16 01:07] Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis Complete

Completed Phase 1 of the investigation. Key findings and actions:
- **Reviewed Session Transcripts**: Re-established context from `SESSION.md`.
- **Identified Decision Points**: Mapped out where worktree creation and usage protocols were violated.
- **Analyzed File Creation Patterns**: Documented instances of files being created in incorrect locations.
- **Reviewed Protocol Documentation**: Examined `SESSIONS-README.md` and `SESSIONS-REFERENCE.md`, confirming clarity on worktree usage but identifying a gap in explicit enforcement of working within the session branch.
- **Considered Strategies for Session Branch Adherence**: Developed a list of strategies to help the agent adhere to the session branch, including pre-command hooks, environment variable enforcement, enhanced shell prompts, automated context switching, and clearer documentation.

The investigation confirms that the core protocol documentation is sound, but the failure was in execution and decision-making, exacerbated by a lack of explicit enforcement mechanisms, particularly for staying within the session branch.

## [2025-10-16 01:30] Research Phase Complete: SOP Best Practices and Passive Restraints

Completed comprehensive research into SOP best practices, error-proofing mechanisms, and workflow validation. Key findings documented in `sop-research-findings.md`:

**Research Areas Covered**:
1. **SOP Best Practices**: Industry standards for creating effective Standard Operating Procedures
2. **Poka-Yoke (Error-Proofing)**: Prevention and detection mechanisms from lean manufacturing
3. **Workflow State Machines**: Validation checkpoints and state transition enforcement
4. **Automated Guardrails**: Pre/post execution validation and enforcement mechanisms

**Critical Discovery**: Repository lacks **passive restraint mechanisms** (e.g., `.roo/rules`, `.cursorrules`) that would provide continuous guidance to AI agents. This absence is a significant contributing factor to protocol violations.

**Key Recommendations**:
1. **Immediate**: Create passive restraint file (`.roo/rules`) with session protocol requirements
2. **Short-term**: Develop four targeted procedural SOPs for session lifecycle phases
3. **Medium-term**: Implement poka-yoke error-proofing mechanisms in session scripts
4. **Long-term**: Deploy workflow state machine validation and automated guardrails

**Updated `analysis-findings.md`**: Added section on missing passive restraints as a new contributing factor.

**Updated `analysis-findings.md`**: Recontextualized and rewrote the document to center on the passive restraint strategy, integrating previous findings and recommendations into this new framework.

**Next Steps**: Review findings with user and determine implementation priorities for Phase 2 (Documentation Enhancement).
